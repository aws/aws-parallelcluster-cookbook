## Branches

### `master` branch

The master branch is the most current code.  For production use, please stick to the most current release from [Supermarket](https://supermarket.chef.io/cookbooks/nfs).  It is not recommended that one uses the `master` branch in production.

If you find a breaking bug in a Supermarket release, let me know via [issues](https://github.com/atomic-penguin/cookbook-nfs/issues) so that I can pull that release from Supermarket, or get a newer release onto Supermarket.

## Tags

Releases are also tagged in git.  See the CHANGELOG.md for a history of what patches are rolled into each release.

## Pull requests

Pull requests are always preferred over just an issue poorly describing a bug.
