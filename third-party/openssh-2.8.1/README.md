# openssh Cookbook

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/chef-cookbooks/openssh.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/chef-cookbooks/openssh) [![Cookbook Version](https://img.shields.io/cookbook/v/openssh.svg)](https://supermarket.chef.io/cookbooks/openssh)

Installs and configures OpenSSH client and daemon.

## Requirements

### Platforms

- Debian/Ubuntu
- RHEL/CentOS/Scientific/Oracle
- Fedora
- FreeBSD
- Suse Enterprise Linux
- openSUSE / openSUSE leap
- AIX 7.1

### Chef

- Chef 12.1+

### Cookbooks

- iptables

## Recipes

### default

Installs openssh packages, manages the sshd config file, configure trusted ca keys, configure revoked keys, and starts/enables the sshd service.

### iptables

Creates an iptables firewall rule to allow inbound SSH connections.

## Usage

Apply the default recipe to the node's run_list to ensure that the openssh packages are installed, sshd is configured, and the service is started and enabled

## Attributes List

The attributes list is dynamically generated, and lines up with the default openssh configs.

This means anything located in [sshd_config](http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=sshd_config&sektion=5) or [ssh_config](http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=sshd_config&sektion=5) can be used in your node attributes.

- If the option can be entered more then once, use an _Array_, otherwise, use a _String_. If the option is host-specific use a `Hash` (please see below for more details).
- Each attribute is stored as ruby case, and converted to camel case for the config file on the fly.
- The current default attributes match the stock `ssh_config` and `sshd_config` provided by openssh.
- The namespace for `sshd_config` is `node['openssh']['server']`.
- Likewise, the namespace for `ssh_config` is `node['openssh']['client']`.
- An attribute can be an `Array`, a `Hash` or a `String`.
- If it is an `Array`, each item in the array will get it's own line in the config file.
- `Hash` attributes are meant to used with `ssh_config` namespace to create host-specific configurations. The keys of the `Hash` will be used as the `Host` entries and their associated entries as the configuration values.
- All the values in openssh are commented out in the `attributes/default.rb` file for a base starting point.
- There is one special attribute name, which is `match`. This is not included in the default template like the others. `node['openssh']['server']['match']` must be a Hash, where the key is the match pattern criteria and the value should be a Hash of normal keywords and values. The same transformations listed above apply to these keywords. See examples below.

## Dynamic ListenAddress

Pass in a `Hash` of interface names, and IP address type(s) to bind sshd to. This will expand to a list of IP addresses which override the default `node['openssh']['server']['listen_address']` value.

## Examples and Common usage

These can be mixed and matched in roles and attributes.  Please note, it is possible to get sshd into a state that it will not run.  If this is the case, you will need to login via an alternate method and debug sshd like normal.

### No Password logins

This requires use of identity files to connect

```json
"openssh": {
  "server": {
    "password_authentication": "no"
  }
}
```

### Change sshd Port

```json
"openssh": {
  "server": {
    "port": "14188"
  }
}
```

### Match

```json
"openssh": {
  "server": {
    "match": {
      "Address 192.168.1.0/24": {
        "password_authentication": "yes"
      },
      "Group admins": {
        "permit_tunnel": "yes",
        "max_sessions": "20"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Enable X Forwarding

```json
"openssh": {
  "server": {
    "x11_forwarding": "yes"
  }
}
```

### Bind to a specific set of address (this example actually binds to all).

Not to be used with `node['openssh']['listen_interfaces']`.

```json
"openssh": {
  "server": {
    "address_family": "any",
      "listen_address": [ "192.168.0.1", "::" ]
    }
  }
}
```

### Bind to the addresses tied to a set of interfaces.

```json
"openssh": {
  "listen_interfaces": {
    "eth0": "inet",
    "eth1": "inet6"
  }
}
```
### Configure Trusted User CA Keys.

```json
"openssh": {
  "ca_keys": [
    "ssh-rsa key... ca_id_1",
    "ssh-rsa key... ca_id_2"
  ]
}
```

### Configure Revoked Keys.

```json
"openssh": {
  "server": {
    "revoked_keys": [
      "ssh-rsa key... user_key_1",
      "ssh-rsa key... user_key_2"
    ]
  }
}
```

### Host-specific configurations with hashes.

You can use a `Hash` with `node['openssh']['client']` to configure different values for different hosts.

```json
"client": {
  "*": {
    "g_s_s_a_p_i_authentication": "yes",
    "send_env": "LANG LC_*",
    "hash_known_hosts": "yes"
  },
  "localhost": {
    "user_known_hosts_file": "/dev/null",
    "strict_host_key_checking": "no"
  },
  "127.0.0.1": {
    "user_known_hosts_file": "/dev/null",
    "strict_host_key_checking": "no"
  },
  "other*": {
    "user_known_hosts_file": "/dev/null",
    "strict_host_key_checking": "no"
  }
}
```

The keys are used as values with the `Host` entries. So, the configuration fragment shown above generates:

```text
Host *
SendEnv LANG LC_*
HashKnownHosts yes
GSSAPIAuthentication yes
Host localhost
StrictHostKeyChecking no
UserKnownHostsFile /dev/null
Host 127.0.0.1
StrictHostKeyChecking no
UserKnownHostsFile /dev/null
Host other*
StrictHostKeyChecking no
UserKnownHostsFile /dev/null
```

### SSH Subsystems

Configure multiple SSH subsystems (e.g. sftp, netconf):

```json
"openssh": {
  "server": {
    "subsystem": {
      "sftp": "/usr/lib/openssh/sftp-server",
      "appX": "/usr/sbin/appX"
    }
  }
}
```

Former declaration of single subsystem:

```json
"openssh": {
  "server": {
    "subsystem": "sftp /usr/lib/openssh/sftp-server"
  }
}
```
