The Yum cookbook exposes the `yum_globalconfig` resource which allows a user to control global yum behavior. This resources aims to allow the user to configure all options listed in the `yum.conf` man page, found at <http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man5/yum.conf.5.html>

## Resources

### yum_globalconfig

This renders a template with global yum configuration parameters. The default recipe uses it to render `/etc/yum.conf`. It is flexible enough to be used in other scenarios, such as building RPMs in isolation by modifying `installroot`.

#### Example

```ruby
yum_globalconfig '/my/chroot/etc/yum.conf' do
  cachedir '/my/chroot/etc/yum.conf'
  keepcache 'yes'
  debuglevel '2'
  installroot '/my/chroot'
  action :create
end
```

#### Properties

`yum_globalconfig` can take most of the same parameters as a `yum_repository`, plus more, too numerous to describe here. Below are a few of the more commonly used ones. For a complete list, please consult the `yum.conf` man page, found here: <http://linux.die.net/man/5/yum.conf>

- `cachedir` - Directory where yum should store its cache and db files. The default is '/var/cache/yum'.
- `keepcache` - Either `true` or `false`. Determines whether or not yum keeps the cache of headers and packages after successful installation. Default is `false`
- `debuglevel` - Debug message output level. Practical range is 0-10\. Default is '2'.
- `exclude` - List of packages to exclude from updates or installs. This should be a space separated list. Shell globs using wildcards (eg. * and ?) are allowed.
- `installonlypkgs` = List of package provides that should only ever be installed, never updated. Kernels in particular fall into this category. Defaults to kernel, kernel-bigmem, kernel-enterprise, kernel-smp, kernel-debug, kernel-unsupported, kernel-source, kernel-devel, kernel-PAE, kernel-PAE-debug.
- `logfile` - Full directory and file name for where yum should write its log file.
- `exactarch` - Either `true` or `false`. Set to `true` to make 'yum update' only update the architectures of packages that you have installed. ie: with this enabled yum will not install an i686 package to update an x86_64 package. Default is `true`
- `gpgcheck` - Either `true` or `false`. This tells yum whether or not it should perform a GPG signature check on the packages gotten from this repository.

### yum_repository

This resource is now provided by chef-client 12.14 and later and has been removed from this cookbook. If you require this resource we highly recommend upgrading your chef-client, but if that is not an option you can pin the 4.X yum cookbook.

## Recipes (deprecated)

- `default` - Configures `yum_globalconfig[/etc/yum.conf]` with values found in node attributes at `node['yum']['main']`

## Attributes

The following attributes are set by default

```ruby
default['yum']['main']['cachedir'] = '/var/cache/yum/$basearch/$releasever'
default['yum']['main']['keepcache'] = false
default['yum']['main']['debuglevel'] = nil
default['yum']['main']['exclude'] = nil
default['yum']['main']['logfile'] = '/var/log/yum.log'
default['yum']['main']['exactarch'] = nil
default['yum']['main']['obsoletes'] = nil
default['yum']['main']['installonly_limit'] = nil
default['yum']['main']['installonlypkgs'] = nil
default['yum']['main']['installroot'] = nil
```

For Amazon platform nodes, the default is to receive a continuous flow of updates,

```ruby
default['yum']['main']['releasever'] = 'latest'
```

To lock existing instances to the current version of the Amazon AMI,

```ruby
default['yum']['main']['releasever'] = ''
```
