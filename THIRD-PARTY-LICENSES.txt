      exercising permissions granted by this License.

      "Source" form shall mean the preferred form for making modifications,
      including but not limited to software source code, documentation
      source, and configuration files.

      "Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical
      transformation or translation of a Source form, including but
      not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,
      and conversions to other media types.

      "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
      Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
      copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
      (an example is provided in the Appendix below).

      "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
      form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
      editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
      represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
      of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
      separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
      the Work and Derivative Works thereof.

      "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
      the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
      to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
      submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
      or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
      the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
      means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
      to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
      communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,

      Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but
      excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
      designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."

      "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
      on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
      subsequently incorporated within the Work.

   2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
      publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
      Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.

   3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
      use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
      where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
      by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
      Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
      with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
      as of the date such litigation is filed.

   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
      meet the following conditions:

      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
          stating that You changed the files; and

      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
          the Derivative Works; and

      (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
          as modifying the License.

      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
      the conditions stated in this License.

   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

Medusa, the asynchronous communications framework upon which
supervisor's server and client code is based, was created by Sam
Rushing:

  Medusa was once distributed under a 'free for non-commercial use'
  license, but in May of 2000 Sam Rushing changed the license to be
  identical to the standard Python license at the time.  The standard
  Python license has always applied to the core components of Medusa,
  this change just frees up the rest of the system, including the http
  server, ftp server, utilities, etc.  Medusa is therefore under the
  following license:

LOSS OF PROFITS) ARISING OUT OF THE USE OF, OR INABILITY TO USE, THE ARM TOOLS,
WHETHER BASED ON A CLAIM UNDER CONTRACT, TORT OR OTHERWISE, EVEN IF ARM WAS
ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

5.2 Arm does not seek to limit or exclude liability for death or personal injury
arising from Armâs negligence or Armâs fraud. Arm acknowledges that certain
jurisdictions do not permit the exclusion or limitation of liability for
consequential or incidental damages, and in such cases the above limitation
relating to liability for consequential damages may not apply to you.

5.3 NOTWITHSTANDING ANYTHING TO THE CONTRARY CONTAINED IN THIS LICENSE, THE
MAXIMUM LIABILITY OF ARM TO YOU IN AGGREGATE (IN CONTRACT, TORT OR OTHERWISE) IN
RELATION TO OR IN CONNECTION WITH THE SUBJECT MATTER OF THIS LICENSE SHALL NOT
EXCEED THE GREATER OF (I) THE TOTAL SUMS PAID BY YOU TO ARM (IF ANY) FOR THIS
LICENSE, AND (II) $10.00 USD. THE EXISTENCE OF MORE THAN ONE CLAIM WILL NOT
ENLARGE OR EXTEND THE LIMIT.

THIRD PARTY MATERIAL
6.1 The Arm Tools may contain material owned or developed by third parties,
including but not limited to open source software, freeware and commercial
software (âThird Party Materialâ). Details relating to such Third Party Material
shall either be presented to you at the time of installation or shall be
detailed in the Third Party Licenses File(s). Your use of such Third Party
Material is subject to your compliance with the applicable Third Party Material
license(s) and such Third Party Material is not covered by this License.

6.2 Arm hereby disclaims any and all warranties express or implied from any
third parties regarding, or otherwise connected with, any Third Party Material
included in the Arm Tools and any Third Party Material from which the Arm Tools
are derived, and/or your use of any or all of the Third Party Material in
connection with Your Software or Your Hardware, including (without limitation)
any warranties of satisfactory quality or fitness for a particular purpose.

6.3 No Third Party Material licensors shall have any liability for any direct,
indirect, incidental, special, exemplary, or consequential damages (including
without limitation lost profits) howsoever caused and whether made under
contract, tort or otherwise arising in any way out of your use or distribution
of the Third Party Material or the exercise of any rights granted under either
or both this License and the legal terms applicable to any Third Party Material,
even if advised in advance of the possibility of such damages.

TERM AND TERMINATION
7.1 Subject to clauses 7.2 and 7.3 below, this License shall remain in force
until terminated by you or Arm.

7.2 Arm may terminate this License at any time for any reason by giving written
notice to you.

7.3 In the event of a party breaching of any of the terms and conditions of this
License, which if capable of remedy, has not been remedied by that party within
thirty (30) days of the date of breach, without prejudice to any of its other
rights under this License, the non-breaching party may terminate this License
immediately upon giving written notice to the breaching party. Upon termination
of this License by you or by Arm you shall immediately (i) stop using the Arm
Tools (or any element thereof) and, (ii) destroy all copies of the same in your
possession or control.

7.4 Notwithstanding the foregoing, except where Arm has terminated this License
for your breach, your rights (if applicable) to distribute any of Your Software
or Your Hardware developed prior to termination of this License, either (i)
developed using the Arm Tools; or incorporating or linking to the Arm Tools or
components thereof (as permitted by this License) shall, subject to your
continued compliance with the terms and conditions of this License, survive such
termination.

7.5 Upon termination of this License, the provisions of clauses 2 to 8 of this
License shall survive.

GENERAL
8.1 This License is governed by English Law. Notwithstanding the foregoing, to
the extent that you are an agency, contractor or instrumentality of the U.S.
Government, disputes arising under or relating to this License shall be decided
under the U.S. federal law of government contracting, including without
limitation the Contract Disputes Act. Nothing in this License shall prevent you
from enforcing your intellectual property rights or seeking injunctive or other
equitable relief in any court of competent jurisdiction. The parties hereby
disclaim application of the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the
International Sale of Goods and the Uniform Computer Information Transactions
Act.

8.2 Except where Arm agrees otherwise in (i) a written contract signed by you
and Arm, or (ii) a written contract provided by Arm and accepted by you, this is
the only agreement between you and Arm relating to the Arm Tools and it may only
be modified by written agreement between you and Arm. No terms and conditions
contained in any purchase order or other document issued by you, or any
advertising or other representation by you or any third party shall add to,
supersede or in any way vary the terms and conditions of this License. This
License (and any documents expressly incorporated into it by reference herein)
represents the entire agreement between you and Arm in relation to its subject
matter.

8.3 If any clause or sentence in this License is held by a court of law to be
illegal or unenforceable, the remaining provisions of this License shall not be
affected. Any failure by Arm to enforce any of the provisions of this License,
unless waived in writing, shall not constitute a waiver of Armâs rights to
enforce such provision or any other provision of this License in the future.

                    GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
                       Version 2, June 1991

 Copyright (C) 1989, 1991 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
 51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA 02110-1301  USA
 Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
 of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

                            Preamble

  The licenses for most software are designed to take away your
freedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public
License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free
software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.  This
General Public License applies to most of the Free Software
Foundation's software and to any other program whose authors commit to
using it.  (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered by
the GNU Library General Public License instead.)  You can apply it to
your programs, too.

  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not
price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you
have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for
this service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it
if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it
in new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.

  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid
anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.
These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you
distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.

  For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether
gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that
you have.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the
source code.  And you must show them these terms so they know their
rights.

  We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and
(2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy,
distribute and/or modify the software.

  Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain
that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free
software.  If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we
want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so
that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original
authors' reputations.

  Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software
patents.  We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free
program will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the
program proprietary.  To prevent this, we have made it clear that any
patent must be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.

  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
modification follow.

                    GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION

  0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains
a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed
under the terms of this General Public License.  The "Program", below,
refers to any such program or work, and a "work based on the Program"
means either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law:
that is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it,
either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another
language.  (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in
the term "modification".)  Each licensee is addressed as "you".

Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not
covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of
running the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program
is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the
Program (independent of having been made by running the Program).
Whether that is true depends on what the Program does.

  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's
source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you
conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate
copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the
notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty;
and give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License
along with the Program.

You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and
you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.

  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion
of it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and
distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1
above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:

    a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices
    stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.

    b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in
    whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any
    part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third
    parties under the terms of this License.

    c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively
    when run, you must cause it, when started running for such
    interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an
    announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a
    notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide
    a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under
    these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this
    License.  (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but
    does not normally print such an announcement, your work based on
    the Program is not required to print an announcement.)

These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If
identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program,
and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in
themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those
sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you
distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based
on the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of
this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the
entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.

Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest
your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to
exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or
collective works based on the Program.

In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program
with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of
a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under
the scope of this License.

  3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it,
under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of
Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:

    a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable
    source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections
    1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,

    b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three
    years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your
    cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete
    machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be
    distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium
    customarily used for software interchange; or,

    c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer
    to distribute corresponding source code.  (This alternative is
    allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you
    received the program in object code or executable form with such
    an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)

The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for
making modifications to it.  For an executable work, complete source
code means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any
associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to
control compilation and installation of the executable.  However, as a
special exception, the source code distributed need not include
anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary
form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the
operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component
itself accompanies the executable.

If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering
access to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent
access to copy the source code from the same place counts as
distribution of the source code, even though third parties are not
compelled to copy the source along with the object code.

  4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program
except as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt
otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is
void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License.
However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under
this License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such
parties remain in full compliance.

  5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not
signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or
distribute the Program or its derivative works.  These actions are
prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by
modifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the
Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and
all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying
the Program or works based on it.

  6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the
Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the
original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to
these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further
restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.
You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to
this License.

  7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),
conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot
distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this
License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you
may not distribute the Program at all.  For example, if a patent
license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by
all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then
the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to
refrain entirely from distribution of the Program.

If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under
any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to
apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other
circumstances.

It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any
patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any
such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the
integrity of the free software distribution system, which is
implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made
generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed
through that system in reliance on consistent application of that
system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing
to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot
impose that choice.

This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to
be a consequence of the rest of this License.

  8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in
certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the
original copyright holder who places the Program under this License
may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding
those countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among
countries not thus excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates
the limitation as if written in the body of this License.

  9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions
of the General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will
be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to
address new problems or concerns.

Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Program
specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and "any
later version", you have the option of following the terms and conditions
either of that version or of any later version published by the Free
Software Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of
this License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software
Foundation.

  10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free
programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author
to ask for permission.  For software which is copyrighted by the Free
Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes
make exceptions for this.  Our decision will be guided by the two goals
of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and
of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.

                            NO WARRANTY

  11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY
FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN
OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES
PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED
OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF
MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS
TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE
PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING,
REPAIR OR CORRECTION.

  12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING
WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR
REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES,
INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING
OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED
TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY
YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER
PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE
POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

                     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

            How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs

  If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest
possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it
free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.

  To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest
to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively
convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least
the "copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.

    <one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.>
    Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>

    This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify
    it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by
    the Free Software Foundation; either version 2 of the License, or
    (at your option) any later version.

    This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,
    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the
    GNU General Public License for more details.

    You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License
    along with this program; if not, write to the Free Software
    Foundation, Inc., 51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA 02110-1301
USA


Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.

If the program is interactive, make it output a short notice like this
when it starts in an interactive mode:

    Gnomovision version 69, Copyright (C) year name of author
    Gnomovision comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w'.
    This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it
    under certain conditions; type `show c' for details.

The hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the appropriate
parts of the General Public License.  Of course, the commands you use may
be called something other than `show w' and `show c'; they could even be
mouse-clicks or menu items--whatever suits your program.

You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your
school, if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the program, if
necessary.  Here is a sample; alter the names:

  Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the program
  `Gnomovision' (which makes passes at compilers) written by James Hacker.

  <signature of Ty Coon>, 1 April 1989
  Ty Coon, President of Vice

This General Public License does not permit incorporating your program into
proprietary programs.  If your program is a subroutine library, you may
consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with the
library.  If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Library General
Public License instead of this License.

Certain source files in this program permit linking with the OpenSSL
library (http://www.openssl.org), which otherwise wouldn't be allowed
under the GPL.  For purposes of identifying OpenSSL, most source files
giving this permission limit it to versions of OpenSSL having a license
identical to that listed in this file (LICENSE.OpenSSL).  It is not
necessary for the copyright years to match between this file and the
OpenSSL version in question.  However, note that because this file is
an extension of the license statements of these source files, this file
may not be changed except with permission from all copyright holders
of source files in this program which reference this file.

GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
Version 2, June 1991

Copyright (C) 1989, 1991 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA  02110-1301, USA

Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this license
document, but changing it is not allowed.

Preamble

The licenses for most software are designed to take away your freedom to share
and change it. By contrast, the GNU General Public License is intended to
guarantee your freedom to share and change free software--to make sure the
software is free for all its users. This General Public License applies to most
of the Free Software Foundation's software and to any other program whose
authors commit to using it. (Some other Free Software Foundation software is
covered by the GNU Lesser General Public License instead.) You can apply it to
your programs, too.

When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price. Our
General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the freedom to
distribute copies of free software (and charge for this service if you wish),
that you receive source code or can get it if you want it, that you can change
the software or use pieces of it in new free programs; and that you know you can
do these things.

To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid anyone to deny
you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights. These restrictions
translate to certain responsibilities for you if you distribute copies of the
software, or if you modify it.

For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether gratis or for a
fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that you have. You must make
sure that they, too, receive or can get the source code. And you must show them
these terms so they know their rights.

We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and (2) offer
you this license which gives you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or
modify the software.

Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain that
everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free software. If the
software is modified by someone else and passed on, we want its recipients to
know that what they have is not the original, so that any problems introduced by
others will not reflect on the original authors' reputations.

Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software patents. We wish
to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free program will individually
obtain patent licenses, in effect making the program proprietary. To prevent
this, we have made it clear that any patent must be licensed for everyone's free
use or not licensed at all.

The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and modification
follow.

TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION

0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains a notice
placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed under the terms of
this General Public License. The "Program", below, refers to any such program or
work, and a "work based on the Program" means either the Program or any
derivative work under copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the
Program or a portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or
translated into another language. (Hereinafter, translation is included without
limitation in the term "modification".) Each licensee is addressed as "you".

Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not covered by
this License; they are outside its scope. The act of running the Program is not
restricted, and the output from the Program is covered only if its contents
constitute a work based on the Program (independent of having been made by
running the Program). Whether that is true depends on what the Program does.

1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's source code as
you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and appropriately
publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty;
keep intact all the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any
warranty; and give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License
along with the Program.

You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and you may at
your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.

2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion of it, thus
forming a work based on the Program, and copy and distribute such modifications
or work under the terms of Section 1 above, provided that you also meet all of
these conditions:

     a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices stating
that you changed the files and the date of any change.

     b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in whole or
in part contains or is derived from the Program or any part thereof, to be
licensed as a whole at no charge to all third parties under the terms of this
License.

     c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively when run,
you must cause it, when started running for such interactive use in the most
ordinary way, to print or display an announcement including an appropriate
copyright notice and a notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that
you provide a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under these
conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this License. (Exception:
if the Program itself is interactive but does not normally print such an
announcement, your work based on the Program is not required to print an
announcement.)

These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole. If identifiable
sections of that work are not derived from the Program, and can be reasonably
considered independent and separate works in themselves, then this License, and
its terms, do not apply to those sections when you distribute them as separate
works. But when you distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a
work based on the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of
this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the entire whole,
and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.

Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest your
rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to exercise the
right to control the distribution of derivative or collective works based on the
Program.

In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program with the
Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of a storage or
distribution medium does not bring the other work under the scope of this
License.

3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it, under Section
2) in object code or executable form under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above
provided that you also do one of the following:

     a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source
code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a
medium customarily used for software interchange; or,

     b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three years, to
give any third party, for a charge no more than your cost of physically
performing source distribution, a complete machine-readable copy of the
corresponding source code, to be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2
above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,

     c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer to
distribute corresponding source code. (This alternative is allowed only for
noncommercial distribution and only if you received the program in object code
or executable form with such an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)

The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for making
modifications to it. For an executable work, complete source code means all the
source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated interface
definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation and installation
of the executable. However, as a special exception, the source code distributed
need not include anything that is normally distributed (in either source or
binary form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the
operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component itself
accompanies the executable.

If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering access to copy
from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the source code
from the same place counts as distribution of the source code, even though third
parties are not compelled to copy the source along with the object code.

4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program except as
expressly provided under this License. Any attempt otherwise to copy, modify,
sublicense or distribute the Program is void, and will automatically terminate
your rights under this License. However, parties who have received copies, or
rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses terminated so
long as such parties remain in full compliance.

5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not signed it.
However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or distribute the Program
or its derivative works. These actions are prohibited by law if you do not
accept this License. Therefore, by modifying or distributing the Program (or any
work based on the Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do
so, and all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying the
Program or works based on it.

6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the Program),
the recipient automatically receives a license from the original licensor to
copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to these terms and conditions.
You may not impose any further restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the
rights granted herein. You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third
parties to this License.

7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent infringement
or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues), conditions are imposed
on you (whether by court order, agreement or otherwise) that contradict the
conditions of this License, they do not excuse you from the conditions of this
License. If you cannot distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your
obligations under this License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a
consequence you may not distribute the Program at all. For example, if a patent
license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by all those
who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then the only way you
could satisfy both it and this License would be to refrain entirely from
distribution of the Program.

If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any
particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply and the
section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances.

It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any patents or
other property right claims or to contest validity of any such claims; this
section has the sole purpose of protecting the integrity of the free software
distribution system, which is implemented by public license practices. Many
people have made generous contributions to the wide range of software
distributed through that system in reliance on consistent application of that
system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing to
distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot impose that
choice.

This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to be a
consequence of the rest of this License.

8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in certain
countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the original copyright
holder who places the Program under this License may add an explicit
geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries, so that
distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus excluded. In such
case, this License incorporates the limitation as if written in the body of this
License.

9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of the
General Public License from time to time. Such new versions will be similar in
spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to address new problems
or concerns.

Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Program specifies
a version number of this License which applies to it and "any later version",
you have the option of following the terms and conditions either of that version
or of any later version published by the Free Software Foundation. If the
Program does not specify a version number of this License, you may choose any
version ever published by the Free Software Foundation.

10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free programs
whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author to ask for
permission. For software which is copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation,
write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this.
Our decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status of
all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing and reuse of
software generally.

NO WARRANTY

11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE
PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED
IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS
IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT
NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A
PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE
PROGRAM IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF
ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.

12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING WILL
ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE
PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL,
SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY
TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING
RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF
THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER
PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs

If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest possible use
to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it free software which
everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.

To do so, attach the following notices to the program. It is safest to attach
them to the start of each source file to most effectively convey the exclusion
of warranty; and each file should have at least the "copyright" line and a
pointer to where the full notice is found.

     one line to give the program's name and an idea of what it does. Copyright
(C) yyyy name of author

     This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify it
under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by the Free
Software Foundation; either version 2 of the License, or (at your option) any
later version.

     This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful, but WITHOUT
ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS
FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. See the GNU General Public License for more details.

     You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License along
with this program; if not, write to the Free Software Foundation, Inc., 51
Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA 02110-1301, USA. Also add information
on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.

If the program is interactive, make it output a short notice like this when it
starts in an interactive mode:

     Gnomovision version 69, Copyright (C) year name of author Gnomovision comes
with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w'. This is free software,
and you are welcome to redistribute it under certain conditions; type `show c'
for details.

The hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the appropriate
parts of the General Public License. Of course, the commands you use may be
called something other than `show w' and `show c'; they could even be mouse-
clicks or menu items--whatever suits your program.

You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your school,
if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the program, if necessary. Here is
a sample; alter the names:

     Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the program
`Gnomovision' (which makes passes at compilers) written by James Hacker.

                       Version 3, 29 June 2007

 Copyright (C) 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc. <http://fsf.org/>
 Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
 of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

                            Preamble

  The GNU General Public License is a free, copyleft license for
software and other kinds of works.

  The licenses for most software and other practical works are designed
to take away your freedom to share and change the works.  By contrast,
the GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to
share and change all versions of a program--to make sure it remains free
software for all its users.  We, the Free Software Foundation, use the
GNU General Public License for most of our software; it applies also to
any other work released this way by its authors.  You can apply it to
your programs, too.

  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not
price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you
have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for
them if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you
want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new
free programs, and that you know you can do these things.

  To protect your rights, we need to prevent others from denying you
these rights or asking you to surrender the rights.  Therefore, you have
certain responsibilities if you distribute copies of the software, or if
you modify it: responsibilities to respect the freedom of others.

  For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether
gratis or for a fee, you must pass on to the recipients the same
freedoms that you received.  You must make sure that they, too, receive
or can get the source code.  And you must show them these terms so they
know their rights.

  Developers that use the GNU GPL protect your rights with two steps:
(1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer you this License
giving you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify it.

  For the developers' and authors' protection, the GPL clearly explains
that there is no warranty for this free software.  For both users' and
authors' sake, the GPL requires that modified versions be marked as
changed, so that their problems will not be attributed erroneously to
authors of previous versions.

  Some devices are designed to deny users access to install or run
modified versions of the software inside them, although the manufacturer
can do so.  This is fundamentally incompatible with the aim of
protecting users' freedom to change the software.  The systematic
pattern of such abuse occurs in the area of products for individuals to
use, which is precisely where it is most unacceptable.  Therefore, we
have designed this version of the GPL to prohibit the practice for those
products.  If such problems arise substantially in other domains, we
stand ready to extend this provision to those domains in future versions
of the GPL, as needed to protect the freedom of users.

  Finally, every program is threatened constantly by software patents.
States should not allow patents to restrict development and use of
software on general-purpose computers, but in those that do, we wish to
avoid the special danger that patents applied to a free program could
make it effectively proprietary.  To prevent this, the GPL assures that
patents cannot be used to render the program non-free.

  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
modification follow.

                       TERMS AND CONDITIONS

  0. Definitions.

  "This License" refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public License.

  "Copyright" also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds of
works, such as semiconductor masks.

  "The Program" refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this
License.  Each licensee is addressed as "you".  "Licensees" and
"recipients" may be individuals or organizations.

  To "modify" a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work
in a fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the making of an
exact copy.  The resulting work is called a "modified version" of the
earlier work or a work "based on" the earlier work.

  A "covered work" means either the unmodified Program or a work based
on the Program.

  To "propagate" a work means to do anything with it that, without
permission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for
infringement under applicable copyright law, except executing it on a
computer or modifying a private copy.  Propagation includes copying,
distribution (with or without modification), making available to the
public, and in some countries other activities as well.

  To "convey" a work means any kind of propagation that enables other
parties to make or receive copies.  Mere interaction with a user through
a computer network, with no transfer of a copy, is not conveying.

  An interactive user interface displays "Appropriate Legal Notices"
to the extent that it includes a convenient and prominently visible
feature that (1) displays an appropriate copyright notice, and (2)
tells the user that there is no warranty for the work (except to the
extent that warranties are provided), that licensees may convey the
work under this License, and how to view a copy of this License.  If
the interface presents a list of user commands or options, such as a
menu, a prominent item in the list meets this criterion.

  1. Source Code.

  The "source code" for a work means the preferred form of the work
for making modifications to it.  "Object code" means any non-source
form of a work.

  A "Standard Interface" means an interface that either is an official
standard defined by a recognized standards body, or, in the case of
interfaces specified for a particular programming language, one that
is widely used among developers working in that language.

  The "System Libraries" of an executable work include anything, other
than the work as a whole, that (a) is included in the normal form of
packaging a Major Component, but which is not part of that Major
Component, and (b) serves only to enable use of the work with that
Major Component, or to implement a Standard Interface for which an
implementation is available to the public in source code form.  A
"Major Component", in this context, means a major essential component
(kernel, window system, and so on) of the specific operating system
(if any) on which the executable work runs, or a compiler used to
produce the work, or an object code interpreter used to run it.

  The "Corresponding Source" for a work in object code form means all
the source code needed to generate, install, and (for an executable
work) run the object code and to modify the work, including scripts to
control those activities.  However, it does not include the work's
System Libraries, or general-purpose tools or generally available free
programs which are used unmodified in performing those activities but
which are not part of the work.  For example, Corresponding Source
includes interface definition files associated with source files for
the work, and the source code for shared libraries and dynamically
linked subprograms that the work is specifically designed to require,
such as by intimate data communication or control flow between those
subprograms and other parts of the work.

  The Corresponding Source need not include anything that users
can regenerate automatically from other parts of the Corresponding
Source.

  The Corresponding Source for a work in source code form is that
same work.

  2. Basic Permissions.

  All rights granted under this License are granted for the term of
copyright on the Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated
conditions are met.  This License explicitly affirms your unlimited
permission to run the unmodified Program.  The output from running a
covered work is covered by this License only if the output, given its
content, constitutes a covered work.  This License acknowledges your
rights of fair use or other equivalent, as provided by copyright law.

  You may make, run and propagate covered works that you do not
convey, without conditions so long as your license otherwise remains
in force.  You may convey covered works to others for the sole purpose
of having them make modifications exclusively for you, or provide you
with facilities for running those works, provided that you comply with
the terms of this License in conveying all material for which you do
not control copyright.  Those thus making or running the covered works
for you must do so exclusively on your behalf, under your direction
and control, on terms that prohibit them from making any copies of
your copyrighted material outside their relationship with you.

  Conveying under any other circumstances is permitted solely under
the conditions stated below.  Sublicensing is not allowed; section 10
makes it unnecessary.

  3. Protecting Users' Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law.

  No covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological
measure under any applicable law fulfilling obligations under article
11 of the WIPO copyright treaty adopted on 20 December 1996, or
similar laws prohibiting or restricting circumvention of such
measures.

  When you convey a covered work, you waive any legal power to forbid
circumvention of technological measures to the extent such circumvention
is effected by exercising rights under this License with respect to
the covered work, and you disclaim any intention to limit operation or
modification of the work as a means of enforcing, against the work's
users, your or third parties' legal rights to forbid circumvention of
technological measures.

  4. Conveying Verbatim Copies.

  You may convey verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you
receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and
appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice;
keep intact all notices stating that this License and any
non-permissive terms added in accord with section 7 apply to the code;
keep intact all notices of the absence of any warranty; and give all
recipients a copy of this License along with the Program.

  You may charge any price or no price for each copy that you convey,
and you may offer support or warranty protection for a fee.

  5. Conveying Modified Source Versions.

  You may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications to
produce it from the Program, in the form of source code under the
terms of section 4, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:

    a) The work must carry prominent notices stating that you modified
    it, and giving a relevant date.

    b) The work must carry prominent notices stating that it is
    released under this License and any conditions added under section
    7.  This requirement modifies the requirement in section 4 to
    "keep intact all notices".

    c) You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this
    License to anyone who comes into possession of a copy.  This
    License will therefore apply, along with any applicable section 7
    additional terms, to the whole of the work, and all its parts,
    regardless of how they are packaged.  This License gives no
    permission to license the work in any other way, but it does not
    invalidate such permission if you have separately received it.

    d) If the work has interactive user interfaces, each must display
    Appropriate Legal Notices; however, if the Program has interactive
    interfaces that do not display Appropriate Legal Notices, your
    work need not make them do so.

  A compilation of a covered work with other separate and independent
works, which are not by their nature extensions of the covered work,
and which are not combined with it such as to form a larger program,
in or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium, is called an
"aggregate" if the compilation and its resulting copyright are not
used to limit the access or legal rights of the compilation's users
beyond what the individual works permit.  Inclusion of a covered work
in an aggregate does not cause this License to apply to the other
parts of the aggregate.

  6. Conveying Non-Source Forms.

  You may convey a covered work in object code form under the terms
of sections 4 and 5, provided that you also convey the
machine-readable Corresponding Source under the terms of this License,
in one of these ways:

    a) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product
    (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by the
    Corresponding Source fixed on a durable physical medium
    customarily used for software interchange.

    b) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product
    (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by a
    written offer, valid for at least three years and valid for as
    long as you offer spare parts or customer support for that product
    model, to give anyone who possesses the object code either (1) a
    copy of the Corresponding Source for all the software in the
    product that is covered by this License, on a durable physical
    medium customarily used for software interchange, for a price no
    more than your reasonable cost of physically performing this
    conveying of source, or (2) access to copy the
    Corresponding Source from a network server at no charge.

    c) Convey individual copies of the object code with a copy of the
    written offer to provide the Corresponding Source.  This
    alternative is allowed only occasionally and noncommercially, and
    only if you received the object code with such an offer, in accord
    with subsection 6b.

    d) Convey the object code by offering access from a designated
    place (gratis or for a charge), and offer equivalent access to the
    Corresponding Source in the same way through the same place at no
    further charge.  You need not require recipients to copy the
    Corresponding Source along with the object code.  If the place to
    copy the object code is a network server, the Corresponding Source
    may be on a different server (operated by you or a third party)
    that supports equivalent copying facilities, provided you maintain
    clear directions next to the object code saying where to find the
    Corresponding Source.  Regardless of what server hosts the
    Corresponding Source, you remain obligated to ensure that it is
    available for as long as needed to satisfy these requirements.

    e) Convey the object code using peer-to-peer transmission, provided
    you inform other peers where the object code and Corresponding
    Source of the work are being offered to the general public at no
    charge under subsection 6d.

  A separable portion of the object code, whose source code is excluded
from the Corresponding Source as a System Library, need not be
included in conveying the object code work.

  A "User Product" is either (1) a "consumer product", which means any
tangible personal property which is normally used for personal, family,
or household purposes, or (2) anything designed or sold for incorporation
into a dwelling.  In determining whether a product is a consumer product,
doubtful cases shall be resolved in favor of coverage.  For a particular
product received by a particular user, "normally used" refers to a
typical or common use of that class of product, regardless of the status
of the particular user or of the way in which the particular user
actually uses, or expects or is expected to use, the product.  A product
is a consumer product regardless of whether the product has substantial
commercial, industrial or non-consumer uses, unless such uses represent
the only significant mode of use of the product.

  "Installation Information" for a User Product means any methods,
procedures, authorization keys, or other information required to install
and execute modified versions of a covered work in that User Product from
a modified version of its Corresponding Source.  The information must
suffice to ensure that the continued functioning of the modified object
code is in no case prevented or interfered with solely because
modification has been made.

  If you convey an object code work under this section in, or with, or
specifically for use in, a User Product, and the conveying occurs as
part of a transaction in which the right of possession and use of the
User Product is transferred to the recipient in perpetuity or for a
fixed term (regardless of how the transaction is characterized), the
Corresponding Source conveyed under this section must be accompanied
by the Installation Information.  But this requirement does not apply
if neither you nor any third party retains the ability to install
modified object code on the User Product (for example, the work has
been installed in ROM).

  The requirement to provide Installation Information does not include a
requirement to continue to provide support service, warranty, or updates
for a work that has been modified or installed by the recipient, or for
the User Product in which it has been modified or installed.  Access to a
network may be denied when the modification itself materially and
adversely affects the operation of the network or violates the rules and
protocols for communication across the network.

  Corresponding Source conveyed, and Installation Information provided,
in accord with this section must be in a format that is publicly
documented (and with an implementation available to the public in
source code form), and must require no special password or key for
unpacking, reading or copying.

  7. Additional Terms.

  "Additional permissions" are terms that supplement the terms of this
License by making exceptions from one or more of its conditions.
Additional permissions that are applicable to the entire Program shall
be treated as though they were included in this License, to the extent
that they are valid under applicable law.  If additional permissions
apply only to part of the Program, that part may be used separately
under those permissions, but the entire Program remains governed by
this License without regard to the additional permissions.

  When you convey a copy of a covered work, you may at your option
remove any additional permissions from that copy, or from any part of
it.  (Additional permissions may be written to require their own
removal in certain cases when you modify the work.)  You may place
additional permissions on material, added by you to a covered work,
for which you have or can give appropriate copyright permission.

  Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, for material you
add to a covered work, you may (if authorized by the copyright holders of
that material) supplement the terms of this License with terms:

    a) Disclaiming warranty or limiting liability differently from the
    terms of sections 15 and 16 of this License; or

    b) Requiring preservation of specified reasonable legal notices or
    author attributions in that material or in the Appropriate Legal
    Notices displayed by works containing it; or

    c) Prohibiting misrepresentation of the origin of that material, or
    requiring that modified versions of such material be marked in
    reasonable ways as different from the original version; or

    d) Limiting the use for publicity purposes of names of licensors or
    authors of the material; or

    e) Declining to grant rights under trademark law for use of some
    trade names, trademarks, or service marks; or

    f) Requiring indemnification of licensors and authors of that
    material by anyone who conveys the material (or modified versions of
    it) with contractual assumptions of liability to the recipient, for
    any liability that these contractual assumptions directly impose on
    those licensors and authors.

  All other non-permissive additional terms are considered "further
restrictions" within the meaning of section 10.  If the Program as you
received it, or any part of it, contains a notice stating that it is
governed by this License along with a term that is a further
restriction, you may remove that term.  If a license document contains
a further restriction but permits relicensing or conveying under this
License, you may add to a covered work material governed by the terms
of that license document, provided that the further restriction does
not survive such relicensing or conveying.

  If you add terms to a covered work in accord with this section, you
must place, in the relevant source files, a statement of the
additional terms that apply to those files, or a notice indicating
where to find the applicable terms.

  Additional terms, permissive or non-permissive, may be stated in the
form of a separately written license, or stated as exceptions;
the above requirements apply either way.

  8. Termination.

  You may not propagate or modify a covered work except as expressly
provided under this License.  Any attempt otherwise to propagate or
modify it is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under
this License (including any patent licenses granted under the third
paragraph of section 11).

  However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your
license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a)
provisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and
finally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright
holder fails to notify you of the violation by some reasonable means
prior to 60 days after the cessation.

  Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is
reinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the
violation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have
received notice of violation of this License (for any work) from that
copyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after
your receipt of the notice.

  Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the
licenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under
this License.  If your rights have been terminated and not permanently
reinstated, you do not qualify to receive new licenses for the same
material under section 10.

  9. Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies.

  You are not required to accept this License in order to receive or
run a copy of the Program.  Ancillary propagation of a covered work
occurring solely as a consequence of using peer-to-peer transmission
to receive a copy likewise does not require acceptance.  However,
nothing other than this License grants you permission to propagate or
modify any covered work.  These actions infringe copyright if you do
not accept this License.  Therefore, by modifying or propagating a
covered work, you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so.

  10. Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients.

  Each time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically
receives a license from the original licensors, to run, modify and
propagate that work, subject to this License.  You are not responsible
for enforcing compliance by third parties with this License.

  An "entity transaction" is a transaction transferring control of an
organization, or substantially all assets of one, or subdividing an
organization, or merging organizations.  If propagation of a covered
work results from an entity transaction, each party to that
transaction who receives a copy of the work also receives whatever
licenses to the work the party's predecessor in interest had or could
give under the previous paragraph, plus a right to possession of the
Corresponding Source of the work from the predecessor in interest, if
the predecessor has it or can get it with reasonable efforts.

  You may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the
rights granted or affirmed under this License.  For example, you may
not impose a license fee, royalty, or other charge for exercise of
rights granted under this License, and you may not initiate litigation
(including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that
any patent claim is infringed by making, using, selling, offering for
sale, or importing the Program or any portion of it.

  11. Patents.

  A "contributor" is a copyright holder who authorizes use under this
License of the Program or a work on which the Program is based.  The
work thus licensed is called the contributor's "contributor version".

  A contributor's "essential patent claims" are all patent claims
owned or controlled by the contributor, whether already acquired or
hereafter acquired, that would be infringed by some manner, permitted
by this License, of making, using, or selling its contributor version,
but do not include claims that would be infringed only as a
consequence of further modification of the contributor version.  For
purposes of this definition, "control" includes the right to grant
patent sublicenses in a manner consistent with the requirements of
this License.

  Each contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free
patent license under the contributor's essential patent claims, to
make, use, sell, offer for sale, import and otherwise run, modify and
propagate the contents of its contributor version.

  In the following three paragraphs, a "patent license" is any express
agreement or commitment, however denominated, not to enforce a patent
(such as an express permission to practice a patent or covenant not to
sue for patent infringement).  To "grant" such a patent license to a
party means to make such an agreement or commitment not to enforce a
patent against the party.

  If you convey a covered work, knowingly relying on a patent license,
and the Corresponding Source of the work is not available for anyone
to copy, free of charge and under the terms of this License, through a
publicly available network server or other readily accessible means,
then you must either (1) cause the Corresponding Source to be so
available, or (2) arrange to deprive yourself of the benefit of the
patent license for this particular work, or (3) arrange, in a manner
consistent with the requirements of this License, to extend the patent
license to downstream recipients.  "Knowingly relying" means you have
actual knowledge that, but for the patent license, your conveying the
covered work in a country, or your recipient's use of the covered work
in a country, would infringe one or more identifiable patents in that
country that you have reason to believe are valid.

  If, pursuant to or in connection with a single transaction or
arrangement, you convey, or propagate by procuring conveyance of, a
covered work, and grant a patent license to some of the parties
receiving the covered work authorizing them to use, propagate, modify
or convey a specific copy of the covered work, then the patent license
you grant is automatically extended to all recipients of the covered
work and works based on it.

  A patent license is "discriminatory" if it does not include within
the scope of its coverage, prohibits the exercise of, or is
conditioned on the non-exercise of one or more of the rights that are
specifically granted under this License.  You may not convey a covered
work if you are a party to an arrangement with a third party that is
in the business of distributing software, under which you make payment
to the third party based on the extent of your activity of conveying
the work, and under which the third party grants, to any of the
parties who would receive the covered work from you, a discriminatory
patent license (a) in connection with copies of the covered work
conveyed by you (or copies made from those copies), or (b) primarily
for and in connection with specific products or compilations that
contain the covered work, unless you entered into that arrangement,
or that patent license was granted, prior to 28 March 2007.

  Nothing in this License shall be construed as excluding or limiting
any implied license or other defenses to infringement that may
otherwise be available to you under applicable patent law.

  12. No Surrender of Others' Freedom.

  If conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot convey a
covered work so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this
License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may
not convey it at all.  For example, if you agree to terms that obligate you
to collect a royalty for further conveying from those to whom you convey
the Program, the only way you could satisfy both those terms and this
License would be to refrain entirely from conveying the Program.

  13. Use with the GNU Affero General Public License.

  Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, you have
permission to link or combine any covered work with a work licensed
under version 3 of the GNU Affero General Public License into a single
combined work, and to convey the resulting work.  The terms of this
License will continue to apply to the part which is the covered work,
but the special requirements of the GNU Affero General Public License,
section 13, concerning interaction through a network will apply to the
combination as such.

  14. Revised Versions of this License.

  The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of
the GNU General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will
be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to
address new problems or concerns.

  Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the
Program specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU General
Public License "or any later version" applies to it, you have the
option of following the terms and conditions either of that numbered
version or of any later version published by the Free Software
Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of the
GNU General Public License, you may choose any version ever published
by the Free Software Foundation.

  If the Program specifies that a proxy can decide which future
versions of the GNU General Public License can be used, that proxy's
public statement of acceptance of a version permanently authorizes you
to choose that version for the Program.

  Later license versions may give you additional or different
permissions.  However, no additional obligations are imposed on any
author or copyright holder as a result of your choosing to follow a
later version.

  15. Disclaimer of Warranty.

  THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY
APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT
HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY
OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO,
THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM
IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF
ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.

  16. Limitation of Liability.

  IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING
WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MODIFIES AND/OR CONVEYS
THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY
GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE
USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF
DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD
PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS),
EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF
SUCH DAMAGES.

  17. Interpretation of Sections 15 and 16.

  If the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of liability provided
above cannot be given local legal effect according to their terms,
reviewing courts shall apply local law that most closely approximates
an absolute waiver of all civil liability in connection with the
Program, unless a warranty or assumption of liability accompanies a
copy of the Program in return for a fee.

                     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

            How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs

  If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest
possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it
free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.

  To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest
to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively
state the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least
the "copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.

    <one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.>
    Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>

    This program is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify
    it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by
    the Free Software Foundation, either version 3 of the License, or
    (at your option) any later version.

    This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,
    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the
    GNU General Public License for more details.

    You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License
    along with this program.  If not, see <http://www.gnu.org/licenses/>.

Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.

  If the program does terminal interaction, make it output a short
notice like this when it starts in an interactive mode:

    <program>  Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>
    This program comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w'.
    This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it
    under certain conditions; type `show c' for details.

The hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the appropriate
parts of the General Public License.  Of course, your program's commands
might be different; for a GUI interface, you would use an "about box".

  You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or school,
if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the program, if necessary.
For more information on this, and how to apply and follow the GNU GPL, see
<http://www.gnu.org/licenses/>.

  The GNU General Public License does not permit incorporating your program
into proprietary programs.  If your program is a subroutine library, you
may consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with
the library.  If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Lesser General
Public License instead of this License.  But first, please read
<http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/why-not-lgpl.html>.

** gcc; version 11.3.0, 9.3.0 -- https://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/gcc/gcc-11.3.0/
This GCC Runtime Library Exception ("Exception") is an additional
permission under section 7 of the GNU General Public License, version
3 ("GPLv3"). It applies to a given file (the "Runtime Library") that
bears a notice placed by the copyright holder of the file stating that
the file is governed by GPLv3 along with this Exception.

When you use GCC to compile a program, GCC may combine portions of
certain GCC header files and runtime libraries with the compiled
program. The purpose of this Exception is to allow compilation of
non-GPL (including proprietary) programs to use, in this way, the
header files and runtime libraries covered by this Exception.

0. Definitions.

A file is an "Independent Module" if it either requires the Runtime
Library for execution after a Compilation Process, or makes use of an
interface provided by the Runtime Library, but is not otherwise based
on the Runtime Library.

"GCC" means a version of the GNU Compiler Collection, with or without
modifications, governed by version 3 (or a specified later version) of
the GNU General Public License (GPL) with the option of using any
subsequent versions published by the FSF.

"GPL-compatible Software" is software whose conditions of propagation,
modification and use would permit combination with GCC in accord with
the license of GCC.

"Target Code" refers to output from any compiler for a real or virtual
target processor architecture, in executable form or suitable for
input to an assembler, loader, linker and/or execution
phase. Notwithstanding that, Target Code does not include data in any
format that is used as a compiler intermediate representation, or used
for producing a compiler intermediate representation.

The "Compilation Process" transforms code entirely represented in
non-intermediate languages designed for human-written code, and/or in
Java Virtual Machine byte code, into Target Code. Thus, for example,
use of source code generators and preprocessors need not be considered
part of the Compilation Process, since the Compilation Process can be
understood as starting with the output of the generators or
preprocessors.

A Compilation Process is "Eligible" if it is done using GCC, alone or
with other GPL-compatible software, or if it is done without using any
work based on GCC. For example, using non-GPL-compatible Software to
optimize any GCC intermediate representations would not qualify as an
Eligible Compilation Process.

1. Grant of Additional Permission.

You have permission to propagate a work of Target Code formed by
combining the Runtime Library with Independent Modules, even if such
propagation would otherwise violate the terms of GPLv3, provided that
all Target Code was generated by Eligible Compilation Processes. You
may then convey such a combination under terms of your choice,
consistent with the licensing of the Independent Modules.

2. No Weakening of GCC Copyleft.

The availability of this Exception does not imply any general
presumption that third-party software is unaffected by the copyleft
requirements of the license of GCC.

Version 3, 29 June 2007

Copyright Â© 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc. https://www.fsf.org

Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this license
document, but changing it is not allowed.

Preamble
The GNU General Public License is a free, copyleft license for software and
other kinds of works.

The licenses for most software and other practical works are designed to take
away your freedom to share and change the works. By contrast, the GNU General
Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change all
versions of a programâto make sure it remains free software for all its users.
We, the Free Software Foundation, use the GNU General Public License for most of
our software; it applies also to any other work released this way by its
authors. You can apply it to your programs, too.

When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price. Our
General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the freedom to
distribute copies of free software (and charge for them if you wish), that you
receive source code or can get it if you want it, that you can change the
software or use pieces of it in new free programs, and that you know you can do
these things.

To protect your rights, we need to prevent others from denying you these rights
or asking you to surrender the rights. Therefore, you have certain
responsibilities if you distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it:
responsibilities to respect the freedom of others.

For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether gratis or for a
fee, you must pass on to the recipients the same freedoms that you received. You
must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source code. And you must
show them these terms so they know their rights.

Developers that use the GNU GPL protect your rights with two steps: (1) assert
copyright on the software, and (2) offer you this License giving you legal
permission to copy, distribute and/or modify it.

For the developersâ and authorsâ protection, the GPL clearly explains that there
is no warranty for this free software. For both usersâ and authorsâ sake, the
GPL requires that modified versions be marked as changed, so that their problems
will not be attributed erroneously to authors of previous versions.

Some devices are designed to deny users access to install or run modified
versions of the software inside them, although the manufacturer can do so. This
is fundamentally incompatible with the aim of protecting usersâ freedom to
change the software. The systematic pattern of such abuse occurs in the area of
products for individuals to use, which is precisely where it is most
unacceptable. Therefore, we have designed this version of the GPL to prohibit
the practice for those products. If such problems arise substantially in other
domains, we stand ready to extend this provision to those domains in future
versions of the GPL, as needed to protect the freedom of users.

Finally, every program is threatened constantly by software patents. States
should not allow patents to restrict development and use of software on general-
purpose computers, but in those that do, we wish to avoid the special danger
that patents applied to a free program could make it effectively proprietary. To
prevent this, the GPL assures that patents cannot be used to render the program
non-free.

The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and modification
follow.

TERMS AND CONDITIONS
0. Definitions.
âThis Licenseâ refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public License.

âCopyrightâ also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds of works,
such as semiconductor masks.

âThe Programâ refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this License. Each
licensee is addressed as âyouâ. âLicenseesâ and ârecipientsâ may be individuals
or organizations.

To âmodifyâ a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work in a
fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the making of an exact copy.
The resulting work is called a âmodified versionâ of the earlier work or a work
âbased onâ the earlier work.

A âcovered workâ means either the unmodified Program or a work based on the
Program.

To âpropagateâ a work means to do anything with it that, without permission,
would make you directly or secondarily liable for infringement under applicable
copyright law, except executing it on a computer or modifying a private copy.
Propagation includes copying, distribution (with or without modification),
making available to the public, and in some countries other activities as well.

To âconveyâ a work means any kind of propagation that enables other parties to
make or receive copies. Mere interaction with a user through a computer network,
with no transfer of a copy, is not conveying.

An interactive user interface displays âAppropriate Legal Noticesâ to the extent
that it includes a convenient and prominently visible feature that (1) displays
an appropriate copyright notice, and (2) tells the user that there is no
warranty for the work (except to the extent that warranties are provided), that
licensees may convey the work under this License, and how to view a copy of this
License. If the interface presents a list of user commands or options, such as a
menu, a prominent item in the list meets this criterion.

1. Source Code.
The âsource codeâ for a work means the preferred form of the work for making
modifications to it. âObject codeâ means any non-source form of a work.

A âStandard Interfaceâ means an interface that either is an official standard
defined by a recognized standards body, or, in the case of interfaces specified
for a particular programming language, one that is widely used among developers
working in that language.

The âSystem Librariesâ of an executable work include anything, other than the
work as a whole, that (a) is included in the normal form of packaging a Major
Component, but which is not part of that Major Component, and (b) serves only to
enable use of the work with that Major Component, or to implement a Standard
Interface for which an implementation is available to the public in source code
form. A âMajor Componentâ, in this context, means a major essential component
(kernel, window system, and so on) of the specific operating system (if any) on
which the executable work runs, or a compiler used to produce the work, or an
object code interpreter used to run it.

The âCorresponding Sourceâ for a work in object code form means all the source
code needed to generate, install, and (for an executable work) run the object
code and to modify the work, including scripts to control those activities.
However, it does not include the workâs System Libraries, or general-purpose
tools or generally available free programs which are used unmodified in
performing those activities but which are not part of the work. For example,
Corresponding Source includes interface definition files associated with source
files for the work, and the source code for shared libraries and dynamically
linked subprograms that the work is specifically designed to require, such as by
intimate data communication or control flow between those subprograms and other
parts of the work.

The Corresponding Source need not include anything that users can regenerate
automatically from other parts of the Corresponding Source.

The Corresponding Source for a work in source code form is that same work.

2. Basic Permissions.
All rights granted under this License are granted for the term of copyright on
the Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated conditions are met. This
License explicitly affirms your unlimited permission to run the unmodified
Program. The output from running a covered work is covered by this License only
if the output, given its content, constitutes a covered work. This License
acknowledges your rights of fair use or other equivalent, as provided by
copyright law.

You may make, run and propagate covered works that you do not convey, without
conditions so long as your license otherwise remains in force. You may convey
covered works to others for the sole purpose of having them make modifications
exclusively for you, or provide you with facilities for running those works,
provided that you comply with the terms of this License in conveying all
material for which you do not control copyright. Those thus making or running
the covered works for you must do so exclusively on your behalf, under your
direction and control, on terms that prohibit them from making any copies of
your copyrighted material outside their relationship with you.

Conveying under any other circumstances is permitted solely under the conditions
stated below. Sublicensing is not allowed; section 10 makes it unnecessary.

3. Protecting Usersâ Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law.
No covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological measure under
any applicable law fulfilling obligations under article 11 of the WIPO copyright
treaty adopted on 20 December 1996, or similar laws prohibiting or restricting
circumvention of such measures.

When you convey a covered work, you waive any legal power to forbid
circumvention of technological measures to the extent such circumvention is
effected by exercising rights under this License with respect to the covered
work, and you disclaim any intention to limit operation or modification of the
work as a means of enforcing, against the workâs users, your or third partiesâ
legal rights to forbid circumvention of technological measures.

4. Conveying Verbatim Copies.
You may convey verbatim copies of the Programâs source code as you receive it,
in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each
copy an appropriate copyright notice; keep intact all notices stating that this
License and any non-permissive terms added in accord with section 7 apply to the
code; keep intact all notices of the absence of any warranty; and give all
recipients a copy of this License along with the Program.

You may charge any price or no price for each copy that you convey, and you may
offer support or warranty protection for a fee.

5. Conveying Modified Source Versions.
You may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications to produce it
from the Program, in the form of source code under the terms of section 4,
provided that you also meet all of these conditions:

The work must carry prominent notices stating that you modified it, and giving a
relevant date.

The work must carry prominent notices stating that it is released under this
License and any conditions added under section 7. This requirement modifies the
requirement in section 4 to âkeep intact all noticesâ.

You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this License to anyone who
comes into possession of a copy. This License will therefore apply, along with
any applicable section 7 additional terms, to the whole of the work, and all its
parts, regardless of how they are packaged. This License gives no permission to
license the work in any other way, but it does not invalidate such permission if
you have separately received it.

If the work has interactive user interfaces, each must display Appropriate Legal
Notices; however, if the Program has interactive interfaces that do not display
Appropriate Legal Notices, your work need not make them do so.

A compilation of a covered work with other separate and independent works, which
are not by their nature extensions of the covered work, and which are not
combined with it such as to form a larger program, in or on a volume of a
storage or distribution medium, is called an âaggregateâ if the compilation and
its resulting copyright are not used to limit the access or legal rights of the
compilationâs users beyond what the individual works permit. Inclusion of a
covered work in an aggregate does not cause this License to apply to the other
parts of the aggregate.

6. Conveying Non-Source Forms.
You may convey a covered work in object code form under the terms of sections 4
and 5, provided that you also convey the machine-readable Corresponding Source
under the terms of this License, in one of these ways:

Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product (including a
physical distribution medium), accompanied by the Corresponding Source fixed on
a durable physical medium customarily used for software interchange.

Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product (including a
physical distribution medium), accompanied by a written offer, valid for at
least three years and valid for as long as you offer spare parts or customer
support for that product model, to give anyone who possesses the object code
either (1) a copy of the Corresponding Source for all the software in the
product that is covered by this License, on a durable physical medium
customarily used for software interchange, for a price no more than your
reasonable cost of physically performing this conveying of source, or (2) access
to copy the Corresponding Source from a network server at no charge.

Convey individual copies of the object code with a copy of the written offer to
provide the Corresponding Source. This alternative is allowed only occasionally
and noncommercially, and only if you received the object code with such an
offer, in accord with subsection 6b.

Convey the object code by offering access from a designated place (gratis or for
a charge), and offer equivalent access to the Corresponding Source in the same
way through the same place at no further charge. You need not require recipients
to copy the Corresponding Source along with the object code. If the place to
copy the object code is a network server, the Corresponding Source may be on a
different server (operated by you or a third party) that supports equivalent
copying facilities, provided you maintain clear directions next to the object
code saying where to find the Corresponding Source. Regardless of what server
hosts the Corresponding Source, you remain obligated to ensure that it is
available for as long as needed to satisfy these requirements.

Convey the object code using peer-to-peer transmission, provided you inform
other peers where the object code and Corresponding Source of the work are being
offered to the general public at no charge under subsection 6d.

A separable portion of the object code, whose source code is excluded from the
Corresponding Source as a System Library, need not be included in conveying the
object code work.

A âUser Productâ is either (1) a âconsumer productâ, which means any tangible
personal property which is normally used for personal, family, or household
purposes, or (2) anything designed or sold for incorporation into a dwelling. In
determining whether a product is a consumer product, doubtful cases shall be
resolved in favor of coverage. For a particular product received by a particular
user, ânormally usedâ refers to a typical or common use of that class of
product, regardless of the status of the particular user or of the way in which
the particular user actually uses, or expects or is expected to use, the
product. A product is a consumer product regardless of whether the product has
substantial commercial, industrial or non-consumer uses, unless such uses
represent the only significant mode of use of the product.

âInstallation Informationâ for a User Product means any methods, procedures,
authorization keys, or other information required to install and execute
modified versions of a covered work in that User Product from a modified version
of its Corresponding Source. The information must suffice to ensure that the
continued functioning of the modified object code is in no case prevented or
interfered with solely because modification has been made.

If you convey an object code work under this section in, or with, or
specifically for use in, a User Product, and the conveying occurs as part of a
transaction in which the right of possession and use of the User Product is
transferred to the recipient in perpetuity or for a fixed term (regardless of
how the transaction is characterized), the Corresponding Source conveyed under
this section must be accompanied by the Installation Information. But this
requirement does not apply if neither you nor any third party retains the
ability to install modified object code on the User Product (for example, the
work has been installed in ROM).

The requirement to provide Installation Information does not include a
requirement to continue to provide support service, warranty, or updates for a
work that has been modified or installed by the recipient, or for the User
Product in which it has been modified or installed. Access to a network may be
denied when the modification itself materially and adversely affects the
operation of the network or violates the rules and protocols for communication
across the network.

Corresponding Source conveyed, and Installation Information provided, in accord
with this section must be in a format that is publicly documented (and with an
implementation available to the public in source code form), and must require no
special password or key for unpacking, reading or copying.

7. Additional Terms.
âAdditional permissionsâ are terms that supplement the terms of this License by
making exceptions from one or more of its conditions. Additional permissions
that are applicable to the entire Program shall be treated as though they were
included in this License, to the extent that they are valid under applicable
law. If additional permissions apply only to part of the Program, that part may
be used separately under those permissions, but the entire Program remains
governed by this License without regard to the additional permissions.

When you convey a copy of a covered work, you may at your option remove any
additional permissions from that copy, or from any part of it. (Additional
permissions may be written to require their own removal in certain cases when
you modify the work.) You may place additional permissions on material, added by
you to a covered work, for which you have or can give appropriate copyright
permission.

Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, for material you add to a
covered work, you may (if authorized by the copyright holders of that material)
supplement the terms of this License with terms:

Disclaiming warranty or limiting liability differently from the terms of
sections 15 and 16 of this License; or

Requiring preservation of specified reasonable legal notices or author
attributions in that material or in the Appropriate Legal Notices displayed by
works containing it; or

Prohibiting misrepresentation of the origin of that material, or requiring that
modified versions of such material be marked in reasonable ways as different
from the original version; or

Limiting the use for publicity purposes of names of licensors or authors of the
material; or

Declining to grant rights under trademark law for use of some trade names,
trademarks, or service marks; or

Requiring indemnification of licensors and authors of that material by anyone
who conveys the material (or modified versions of it) with contractual
assumptions of liability to the recipient, for any liability that these
contractual assumptions directly impose on those licensors and authors.

All other non-permissive additional terms are considered âfurther restrictionsâ
within the meaning of section 10. If the Program as you received it, or any part
of it, contains a notice stating that it is governed by this License along with
a term that is a further restriction, you may remove that term. If a license
document contains a further restriction but permits relicensing or conveying
under this License, you may add to a covered work material governed by the terms
of that license document, provided that the further restriction does not survive
such relicensing or conveying.

If you add terms to a covered work in accord with this section, you must place,
in the relevant source files, a statement of the additional terms that apply to
those files, or a notice indicating where to find the applicable terms.

Additional terms, permissive or non-permissive, may be stated in the form of a
separately written license, or stated as exceptions; the above requirements
apply either way.

8. Termination.
You may not propagate or modify a covered work except as expressly provided
under this License. Any attempt otherwise to propagate or modify it is void, and
will automatically terminate your rights under this License (including any
patent licenses granted under the third paragraph of section 11).

However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your license from a
particular copyright holder is reinstated (a) provisionally, unless and until
the copyright holder explicitly and finally terminates your license, and (b)
permanently, if the copyright holder fails to notify you of the violation by
some reasonable means prior to 60 days after the cessation.

Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated
permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the violation by some
reasonable means, this is the first time you have received notice of violation
of this License (for any work) from that copyright holder, and you cure the
violation prior to 30 days after your receipt of the notice.

Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the licenses of
parties who have received copies or rights from you under this License. If your
rights have been terminated and not permanently reinstated, you do not qualify
to receive new licenses for the same material under section 10.

9. Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies.
You are not required to accept this License in order to receive or run a copy of
the Program. Ancillary propagation of a covered work occurring solely as a
consequence of using peer-to-peer transmission to receive a copy likewise does
not require acceptance. However, nothing other than this License grants you
permission to propagate or modify any covered work. These actions infringe
copyright if you do not accept this License. Therefore, by modifying or
propagating a covered work, you indicate your acceptance of this License to do
so.

10. Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients.
Each time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically receives a
license from the original licensors, to run, modify and propagate that work,
subject to this License. You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by
third parties with this License.

An âentity transactionâ is a transaction transferring control of an
organization, or substantially all assets of one, or subdividing an
organization, or merging organizations. If propagation of a covered work results
from an entity transaction, each party to that transaction who receives a copy
of the work also receives whatever licenses to the work the partyâs predecessor
in interest had or could give under the previous paragraph, plus a right to
possession of the Corresponding Source of the work from the predecessor in
interest, if the predecessor has it or can get it with reasonable efforts.

You may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the rights
granted or affirmed under this License. For example, you may not impose a
license fee, royalty, or other charge for exercise of rights granted under this
License, and you may not initiate litigation (including a cross-claim or
counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that any patent claim is infringed by
making, using, selling, offering for sale, or importing the Program or any
portion of it.

11. Patents.
A âcontributorâ is a copyright holder who authorizes use under this License of
the Program or a work on which the Program is based. The work thus licensed is
called the contributorâs âcontributor versionâ.

A contributorâs âessential patent claimsâ are all patent claims owned or
controlled by the contributor, whether already acquired or hereafter acquired,
that would be infringed by some manner, permitted by this License, of making,
using, or selling its contributor version, but do not include claims that would
be infringed only as a consequence of further modification of the contributor
version. For purposes of this definition, âcontrolâ includes the right to grant
patent sublicenses in a manner consistent with the requirements of this License.

Each contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free patent
license under the contributorâs essential patent claims, to make, use, sell,
offer for sale, import and otherwise run, modify and propagate the contents of
its contributor version.

In the following three paragraphs, a âpatent licenseâ is any express agreement
or commitment, however denominated, not to enforce a patent (such as an express
permission to practice a patent or covenant not to sue for patent infringement).
To âgrantâ such a patent license to a party means to make such an agreement or
commitment not to enforce a patent against the party.

If you convey a covered work, knowingly relying on a patent license, and the
Corresponding Source of the work is not available for anyone to copy, free of
charge and under the terms of this License, through a publicly available network
server or other readily accessible means, then you must either (1) cause the
Corresponding Source to be so available, or (2) arrange to deprive yourself of
the benefit of the patent license for this particular work, or (3) arrange, in a
manner consistent with the requirements of this License, to extend the patent
license to downstream recipients. âKnowingly relyingâ means you have actual
knowledge that, but for the patent license, your conveying the covered work in a
country, or your recipientâs use of the covered work in a country, would
infringe one or more identifiable patents in that country that you have reason
to believe are valid.

If, pursuant to or in connection with a single transaction or arrangement, you
convey, or propagate by procuring conveyance of, a covered work, and grant a
patent license to some of the parties receiving the covered work authorizing
them to use, propagate, modify or convey a specific copy of the covered work,
then the patent license you grant is automatically extended to all recipients of
the covered work and works based on it.

A patent license is âdiscriminatoryâ if it does not include within the scope of
its coverage, prohibits the exercise of, or is conditioned on the non-exercise
of one or more of the rights that are specifically granted under this License.
You may not convey a covered work if you are a party to an arrangement with a
third party that is in the business of distributing software, under which you
make payment to the third party based on the extent of your activity of
conveying the work, and under which the third party grants, to any of the
parties who would receive the covered work from you, a discriminatory patent
license (a) in connection with copies of the covered work conveyed by you (or
copies made from those copies), or (b) primarily for and in connection with
specific products or compilations that contain the covered work, unless you
entered into that arrangement, or that patent license was granted, prior to 28
March 2007.

Nothing in this License shall be construed as excluding or limiting any implied
license or other defenses to infringement that may otherwise be available to you
under applicable patent law.

12. No Surrender of Othersâ Freedom.
If conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not excuse
you from the conditions of this License. If you cannot convey a covered work so
as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this License and any other
pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may not convey it at all. For
example, if you agree to terms that obligate you to collect a royalty for
further conveying from those to whom you convey the Program, the only way you
could satisfy both those terms and this License would be to refrain entirely
from conveying the Program.

13. Use with the GNU Affero General Public License.
Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, you have permission to link
or combine any covered work with a work licensed under version 3 of the GNU
Affero General Public License into a single combined work, and to convey the
resulting work. The terms of this License will continue to apply to the part
which is the covered work, but the special requirements of the GNU Affero
General Public License, section 13, concerning interaction through a network
will apply to the combination as such.

14. Revised Versions of this License.
The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of the GNU
General Public License from time to time. Such new versions will be similar in
spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to address new problems
or concerns.

Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Program specifies
that a certain numbered version of the GNU General Public License âor any later
versionâ applies to it, you have the option of following the terms and
conditions either of that numbered version or of any later version published by
the Free Software Foundation. If the Program does not specify a version number
of the GNU General Public License, you may choose any version ever published by
the Free Software Foundation.

If the Program specifies that a proxy can decide which future versions of the
GNU General Public License can be used, that proxyâs public statement of
acceptance of a version permanently authorizes you to choose that version for
the Program.

Later license versions may give you additional or different permissions.
However, no additional obligations are imposed on any author or copyright holder
as a result of your choosing to follow a later version.

15. Disclaimer of Warranty.
THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.
EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER
PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM âAS ISâ WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER
EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF
MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE
QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE
DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.

16. Limitation of Liability.
IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING WILL ANY
COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MODIFIES AND/OR CONVEYS THE PROGRAM AS
PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL,
INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE
THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED
INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE
PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY
HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

17. Interpretation of Sections 15 and 16.
If the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of liability provided above cannot
be given local legal effect according to their terms, reviewing courts shall
apply local law that most closely approximates an absolute waiver of all civil
liability in connection with the Program, unless a warranty or assumption of
liability accompanies a copy of the Program in return for a fee.

Each Contributor hereby grants You a world-wide, royalty-free,
non-exclusive license:

(a) under intellectual property rights (other than patent or trademark)
    Licensable by such Contributor to use, reproduce, make available,
    modify, display, perform, distribute, and otherwise exploit its
    Contributions, either on an unmodified basis, with Modifications, or
    as part of a Larger Work; and

(b) under Patent Claims of such Contributor to make, use, sell, offer
    for sale, have made, import, and otherwise transfer either its
    Contributions or its Contributor Version.

2.2. Effective Date

The licenses granted in Section 2.1 with respect to any Contribution
become effective for each Contribution on the date the Contributor first
distributes such Contribution.

2.3. Limitations on Grant Scope

The licenses granted in this Section 2 are the only rights granted under
this License. No additional rights or licenses will be implied from the
distribution or licensing of Covered Software under this License.
Notwithstanding Section 2.1(b) above, no patent license is granted by a
Contributor:

(a) for any code that a Contributor has removed from Covered Software;
    or

(b) for infringements caused by: (i) Your and any other third party's
    modifications of Covered Software, or (ii) the combination of its
    Contributions with other software (except as part of its Contributor
    Version); or

(c) under Patent Claims infringed by Covered Software in the absence of
    its Contributions.

This License does not grant any rights in the trademarks, service marks,
or logos of any Contributor (except as may be necessary to comply with
the notice requirements in Section 3.4).

2.4. Subsequent Licenses

No Contributor makes additional grants as a result of Your choice to
distribute the Covered Software under a subsequent version of this
License (see Section 10.2) or under the terms of a Secondary License (if
permitted under the terms of Section 3.3).

2.5. Representation

Each Contributor represents that the Contributor believes its
Contributions are its original creation(s) or it has sufficient rights
to grant the rights to its Contributions conveyed by this License.

2.6. Fair Use

This License is not intended to limit any rights You have under
applicable copyright doctrines of fair use, fair dealing, or other
equivalents.

2.7. Conditions

Sections 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, and 3.4 are conditions of the licenses granted
in Section 2.1.

3. Responsibilities
-------------------

3.1. Distribution of Source Form

All distribution of Covered Software in Source Code Form, including any
Modifications that You create or to which You contribute, must be under
the terms of this License. You must inform recipients that the Source
Code Form of the Covered Software is governed by the terms of this
License, and how they can obtain a copy of this License. You may not
attempt to alter or restrict the recipients' rights in the Source Code
Form.

3.2. Distribution of Executable Form

If You distribute Covered Software in Executable Form then:

(a) such Covered Software must also be made available in Source Code
    Form, as described in Section 3.1, and You must inform recipients of
    the Executable Form how they can obtain a copy of such Source Code
    Form by reasonable means in a timely manner, at a charge no more
    than the cost of distribution to the recipient; and

(b) You may distribute such Executable Form under the terms of this
    License, or sublicense it under different terms, provided that the
    license for the Executable Form does not attempt to limit or alter
    the recipients' rights in the Source Code Form under this License.

3.3. Distribution of a Larger Work

You may create and distribute a Larger Work under terms of Your choice,
provided that You also comply with the requirements of this License for
the Covered Software. If the Larger Work is a combination of Covered
Software with a work governed by one or more Secondary Licenses, and the
Covered Software is not Incompatible With Secondary Licenses, this
License permits You to additionally distribute such Covered Software
under the terms of such Secondary License(s), so that the recipient of
the Larger Work may, at their option, further distribute the Covered
Software under the terms of either this License or such Secondary
License(s).

3.4. Notices

You may not remove or alter the substance of any license notices
(including copyright notices, patent notices, disclaimers of warranty,
or limitations of liability) contained within the Source Code Form of
the Covered Software, except that You may alter any license notices to
the extent required to remedy known factual inaccuracies.

3.5. Application of Additional Terms

You may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty, support,
indemnity or liability obligations to one or more recipients of Covered
Software. However, You may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on
behalf of any Contributor. You must make it absolutely clear that any
such warranty, support, indemnity, or liability obligation is offered by
You alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify every Contributor for any
liability incurred by such Contributor as a result of warranty, support,
indemnity or liability terms You offer. You may include additional
disclaimers of warranty and limitations of liability specific to any
jurisdiction.

4. Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation
---------------------------------------------------

If it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this
License with respect to some or all of the Covered Software due to
statute, judicial order, or regulation then You must: (a) comply with
the terms of this License to the maximum extent possible; and (b)
describe the limitations and the code they affect. Such description must
be placed in a text file included with all distributions of the Covered
Software under this License. Except to the extent prohibited by statute
or regulation, such description must be sufficiently detailed for a
recipient of ordinary skill to be able to understand it.

5. Termination
--------------

5.1. The rights granted under this License will terminate automatically
if You fail to comply with any of its terms. However, if You become
compliant, then the rights granted under this License from a particular
Contributor are reinstated (a) provisionally, unless and until such
Contributor explicitly and finally terminates Your grants, and (b) on an
ongoing basis, if such Contributor fails to notify You of the
non-compliance by some reasonable means prior to 60 days after You have
come back into compliance. Moreover, Your grants from a particular
Contributor are reinstated on an ongoing basis if such Contributor
notifies You of the non-compliance by some reasonable means, this is the
first time You have received notice of non-compliance with this License
from such Contributor, and You become compliant prior to 30 days after
Your receipt of the notice.

5.2. If You initiate litigation against any entity by asserting a patent
infringement claim (excluding declaratory judgment actions,
counter-claims, and cross-claims) alleging that a Contributor Version
directly or indirectly infringes any patent, then the rights granted to
You by any and all Contributors for the Covered Software under Section
2.1 of this License shall terminate.

5.3. In the event of termination under Sections 5.1 or 5.2 above, all
end user license agreements (excluding distributors and resellers) which
have been validly granted by You or Your distributors under this License
prior to termination shall survive termination.

END-USER LICENSE AGREEMENT (EULA)
for NICE Software and Solutions
(Version 8.3)

This End User License Agreement ("EULA" or "Agreement") contains the terms
and conditions that govern your ("Licensee" or "you" or "your") access to and
use of NICE EnginFrame and NICE DCV (together with any updates or
enhancements, and accompanying documentation, "Software") and NICE DCV Web
Client software development kit ("SDK"). As used in this EULA, "NICE" means
NICE, S.r.l. with principal offices located at Via Milliavacca, 9 - 14100
Asti - Italy ("NICE IT"), except that if Licensee is located in the United
States, "NICE" means NICE USA LLC, with principal offices at 410 Terry Avenue
North, Seattle, Washington, 98109-5210 ("NICE US"). This EULA supplements
the AWS Customer Agreement posted at aws.amazon.com/agreement or other
agreement with NICE or an affiliate governing your use of NICE services (the
"Customer Agreement"), and unless otherwise defined in this EULA, capitalized
terms will have the same meaning as set forth in the Customer Agreement.

1. LICENSE TO AND USE OF THE SOFTWARE. The Software may be accessed and used
only in accordance with this EULA and the Customer Agreement, and subject to
these terms:
(a) You are granted a limited, non-transferable, revocable, non-sublicensable
license to install and use the Software for your internal business purposes
only and only in the quantity that you have purchased from NICE or an
authorized reseller of the Software, or to the extent your use has otherwise
been authorized by NICE or Amazon Web Services.
(b) if you requested access to the Software to evaluate its features and
functionality, you are granted a limited, non-transferable, revocable,
non-sublicensable license to install and use the Software for your internal
evaluation and testing purposes only, and only in the quantity that you have
requested from NICE.

2. BETA PARTICIPATION. NICE may provide Licensee certain features,
technologies, software, and services that are not yet generally available,
including those labeled "beta", "preview", "pre-release", or "experimental"
(each, a "Beta"). Access and use of Betas are subject to any Beta terms
provided by NICE and if there is a conflict between the terms of this Section
and any Beta terms, Beta terms will take precedence. Betas are Software
subject to all the terms and conditions of this EULA.
(a) Licensee agrees not to allow access to or use of any Beta or any related
materials by any third party other than Licensee's employees and contractors
who have a need to use or access in connection with Licensee's internal
evaluation activities and have executed written non-disclosure agreements
obligating them to protect the confidentiality of the Beta and related
materials.
(b) Licensee must comply with all policies and guidelines related to any Beta
as posted on the NICE's website or otherwise made available to Licensee. NICE
may add or modify restrictions, including usage limits related to access to
or use of any Beta or related materials at any time. If requested by NICE,
Licensee will promptly increase or decrease usage to the levels that NICE may
specify. Any service level agreements that Licensee may have for the Software
do not apply to Betas.
(c) Licensee will, when requested by NICE, provide NICE with information
relating to Licensee's access, use, testing, and evaluation of the Beta and
any related Beta Materials, including observations or information regarding
the performance, features, and functionality of the Beta in the form
reasonably requested by NICE ("Test Observations"). NICE will own and may use
and evaluate all Test Observations for its own purposes. All Betas, related
materials, and Test Observations are NICE Confidential Information. Each
individual Beta license will automatically terminate upon the release of a
generally available version of the Beta or upon notice of termination by NICE
which may occur at any time and for any reason. Upon the termination of
Licensee's license to any Beta, Licensee will cease use of the Beta and
immediately return or, if instructed by NICE, destroy all copies of the Beta
and all related materials. NICE does not guarantee that any Beta will ever be
made generally available or that any generally available version will contain
the same or similar functionality as any Beta version made available to
Licensee.
(d) WITHOUT LIMITING ANY DISCLAIMERS HEREIN, BETAS ARE NOT READY FOR GENERAL
COMMERCIAL RELEASE AND MAY CONTAIN BUGS, ERRORS, DEFECTS OR HARMFUL
COMPONENTS. ACCORDINGLY, AND NOTWITHSTANDING ANYTHING TO THE CONTRARY IN THIS
EULA OR OTHERWISE, NICE PROVIDES BETAS TO LICENSEE "AS IS."

3. USE RESTRICTIONS. Your use of the Software is conditioned upon your
compliance with the following limitations:
(a) Licensee will not distribute, rent, lease, lend, loan, transfer, assign,
resell, sublicense, disclose, or otherwise provide the Software to or use the
Software for the benefit of any third party (including acting as a service
bureau or provide of a time sharing service). Notwithstanding the foregoing,
Licensee may permit its third party contractors to use the software for
Licensee's internal business purposes provided that Licensee enters to a
binding agreement with contractor requiring contractor to comply with this
EULA and is solely responsible and liable for any breach of this EULA
including any unauthorized use of the Software by Licensee's contractors.
(b) Licensee will not modify, adapt, translate, alter, tamper with, repair,
or otherwise create derivative works of the Software, subject to Section 10.
(c) Licensee will not decompile, decipher, disassemble, reverse engineer or
otherwise attempt to access or derive source code of the Software, except to
the extent applicable law does not allow this restriction.
(d) Licensee will not attempt to use the Software in excess of any usage
limits and will not attempt to circumvent any technology in or with the
Software that is designed to monitor, restrict, or limit use. Licensee
acknowledges and agrees that the Software (including all evaluation versions)
may require the use of license key or token in order to operate and that
operation of the Software will automatically terminate upon expiration.
(e) Licensee will not remove any proprietary notices or labels on the
Software or any copy thereof.
(f) Licensee requires that each end user before accessing the Software,
agrees to comply with this EULA.
(g) Licensee will not make any use of the Software in any manner not
expressly permitted by this EULA.

4. INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY.
(a) The Software and SDK (including the related documentation) are owned by
NICE. Licensee acknowledges and agrees that title to the Software and SDK,
including the documentation, and all the copies thereof, including all
industrial and intellectual property rights (including the exclusive rights
of economic exploitation), copyright, trade secrets, and patent rights,
remains with NICE.
(b) Licensee has no obligation to give NICE any suggestions, comments, or
other feedback relating to the Software ("Feedback"). To the extent Licensee
provides Feedback to NICE, NICE may use and exercise any and all rights in
the Feedback without obligation or restriction of any kind during and after
the Term, and Feedback will not be deemed to be confidential information of
Licensee or otherwise create any confidentiality obligation. Licensee agrees
not to provide any Feedback that: (i) Licensee knows is subject to any
patent, copyright or other intellectual property claim or right of any third
party; or (ii) is subject to license terms which seek to require any products
incorporating or derived from the Feedback, or other NICE intellectual
property, to be licensed to or otherwise shared with any third party.

5. AUDIT. Licensee shall maintain accurate records regarding Licensee's use
of the Software and compliance with this EULA and, upon request, make such
records available to NICE and certify Licensee's compliance with this EULA.
NICE or a third party may examine and audit Licensee's access, use, and
deployment of the Software and verify Licensee's compliance with this EULA.
Any audit will take place during normal business hours on at least 10 days
prior written notice. If Licensee misreported any figure or underpaid any
amount, Licensee will remit to NICE the amount of any underpayment within 10
days after notification of the discrepancy. If the discrepancy exceeds $1,000
U.S. dollars or 5% of the total amount purchased or reported by Licensee for
the period audited, then Licensee will reimburse NICE for the reasonable
costs of the audit.

6. SUPPORT SERVICES. Licensee may be eligible to subscribe to software
support for any or all of the Software (the "Support Services", as described
and regulated under the Standard Support Services for NICE Products terms,
available here
https://www.nice-software.com/html/pdf/NICE_Standard_Support_Services.pdf, as
may be updated). Support Services are subject to and governed by the terms of
this EULA and the Customer Agreement, as is any update or upgrade to the
Software provided by NICE in connection with Support Services. If the Support
Services are terminated, Licensee's license to the Software under this EULA
will continue in accordance with the terms of this EULA. If Support Services
expire or terminate and Licensee later reinstates Support Services, Licensee
shall pay a reinstatement fee equal to 70% of the current annual charge for
Support Services for the period of time when Licensee did not receive Support
Services. The reinstatement fee for any partial year will be a pro rata
portion of the applicable annual fee.

7. LIMITED WARRANTY.
(a) NICE warrants that the Software will for a period of 60 days from
delivery to the Licensee (the "Warranty Period"), when used in accordance
with NICE's written instructions, operate substantially in compliance with
NICE's official published documentation. NICE's sole responsibility, and
Licensee's exclusive remedy, in the event of breach of the limited warranty
during the Warranty Period, is for NICE, at its option, to use reasonable
efforts to repair the Software, replace the Software, or provide a refund.
NICE shall not be responsible or liable for any noncompliance with the
foregoing warranty or limitations or defects of the Software, if they have
been caused, in whole or in part, by unauthorized behavior of Licensee, any
use of the Software which is inconsistent with the Documentation, any
accident, abuse, or misapplication, and/or if they arise from or are related
to software or any other products which are not supplied by NICE.
(b) DISCLAIMER. EXCEPT FOR THE LIMITED WARRANTY IN SECTION 7(A), THE SOFTWARE
IS PROVIDED "AS IS." EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT PROHIBITED BY LAW, OR TO THE EXTENT
ANY STATUTORY RIGHTS APPLY THAT CANNOT BE EXCLUDED, LIMITED OR WAIVED, NICE

IMPLIED OR EXPRESS WARRANTIES (A) OF MERCHANTABILITY, SATISFACTORY QUALITY,
FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, OR QUIET ENJOYMENT, (B)
ARISING OUT OF ANY COURSE OF DEALING OR USAGE OF TRADE, (C) THAT THE SOFTWARE
WILL BE UNINTERRUPTED, ERROR FREE, OR FREE OF HARMFUL COMPONENTS, AND (D)
THAT ANY CONTENT WILL BE SECURE OR NOT OTHERWISE LOST OR ALTERED.

8. LIMITATIONS OF LIABILITY. NICE AND ITS AFFILIATES AND LICENSORS WILL NOT
BE LIABLE TO LICENSEE FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL,
CONSEQUENTIAL OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES (INCLUDING DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF PROFITS,
REVENUES, CUSTOMERS, OPPORTUNITIES, GOODWILL, USE, OR DATA), EVEN IF A PARTY
HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. FURTHER, NEITHER NICE
NOR ANY OF ITS AFFILIATES OR LICENSORS WILL BE RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY
COMPENSATION, REIMBURSEMENT, OR DAMAGES ARISING IN CONNECTION WITH: (A) YOUR
INABILITY TO USE THE SOFTWARE, INCLUDING AS A RESULT OF ANY (I) TERMINATION
OR EXPIRATION OF THIS EULA OR YOUR USE OF OR ACCESS TO THE SOFTWARE OR, (II)
ANY ERROR OR UNANTICIPATED INTERUPTION IN THE OPERATION OF THE SOFTWARE FOR
ANY REASON; (B) THE COST OF PROCUREMENT OF SUBSTITUTE GOODS OR SERVICES; (C)
ANY INVESTMENTS, EXPENDITURES, OR COMMITMENTS BY LICENSEE IN CONNECTION WITH
THIS EULA OR YOUR USE OF OR ACCESS TO THE SOFTWARE; OR (D) ANY UNAUTHORIZED

NICE DCV Web Client solely to the extent those derivative works implement the
NICE DCV Web Client, subject to the following conditions:
(a) You will not remove any proprietary notices or labels on the SDK or any
copy thereof.
(b) You will include this permission notice in all copies or substantial
portions of the SDK.
(c) You require that each end user before accessing the SDK, NICE DCV Web
Client, or any copies, derivative works or substantial portions thereof,
agrees to comply with this EULA.
(d) Some components of the SDK may be governed by third party software
licenses. Your license rights with respect to these individual components are
defined by the applicable third party software licenses, and nothing in this
Agreement will restrict, limit, or otherwise affect any rights or obligations
you may have, or conditions to which you may be subject, under such third
party software licenses.
(e) THE SDK IS PROVIDED "AS IS", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR
IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY,
FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT. IN NO EVENT SHALL THE
AUTHORS OR COPYRIGHT HOLDERS BE LIABLE FOR ANY CLAIM, DAMAGES OR OTHER
LIABILITY, WHETHER IN AN ACTION OF CONTRACT, TORT OR OTHERWISE, ARISING FROM,
OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THE SDK OR THE USE OR OTHER DEALINGS IN THE
SOFTWARE.

11. GENERAL.
(a) Entire Agreement. This EULA and its incorporation of the Customer
Agreement, along with related documents provided by NICE, represents the
complete and exclusive agreement between the parties with respect to the
subject matter hereof and supersedes all prior agreements, negotiations, and
understandings. NICE will not be bound by, and specifically objects to, any
term, condition or other provision that is different from or in addition to
the provisions of this EULA (whether or not it would materially alter this
EULA) including for example, any term, condition or other provision (i)
submitted by Licensee in any purchase order, receipt, acceptance,
confirmation, correspondence or other document, or (ii) related to any
invoicing process that Licensee submits or require NICE to complete. To the
extent there is any conflict between this EULA and the Customer Agreement,
this EULA prevails.
(b) Assignment. Licensee shall not assign or otherwise transfer this EULA or
any of Licensee's rights or obligations, without our prior written consent.
Any assignment or transfer in violation of this Section will be void. NICE
may assign this EULA without your consent (i) in connection with a merger,
acquisition or sale of all or substantially all of our assets, or (ii) to any
affiliate or as part of a corporate reorganization; and effective upon such
assignment, the assignee is deemed substituted for NICE as a party to this
EULA and NICE is fully released from all of its obligations and duties to
perform under this EULA. Subject to the foregoing, this EULA will be binding
upon, and inure to the benefit of the parties and their respective permitted
successors and assigns.
(c) Governing Law and Dispute Resolution for US Licensees. If NICE US is the
contracting party to this EULA, the laws of the State of Washington, without
reference to conflict of law rules, govern this EULA and any dispute of any
sort that might arise between NICE and Licensee. The United Nations
Convention for the International Sale of Goods does not apply to this EULA.
Any dispute or claim relating in any way to the Software or this EULA will be
adjudicated exclusively in the federal and state courts located in King
County, Washington, and Licensee consents and waives any objections to such
exclusive jurisdiction and venue. Notwithstanding the foregoing, NICE may
seek injunctive (or similar) remedies in any jurisdiction.
(d) Governing Law and Dispute Resolution when Licensees Outside the US.
(i) If NICE IT is the contracting party to this EULA, the laws of the
Republic of Italy, without reference to conflict of law rules, govern this
EULA and any dispute of any sort that might arise between NICE and Licensee.
The United Nations Convention for the International Sale of Goods does not
apply to this EULA. Any dispute or claim relating in any way to the Software
or this EULA will be adjudicated exclusively in the Court of Milan, Italy,
and Licensee consents and waives any objections to such exclusive
jurisdiction and venue. Notwithstanding the foregoing, NICE may seek
injunctive (or similar) remedies in any jurisdiction.
(ii) IF NICE IT IS THE CONTRACTING PARTY, PURSUANT TO AND BY THE EFFECT OF
SECTIONS 1341 AND 1342 OF THE ITALIAN CIVIL CODE, LICENSEE EXPLICITLY
APPROVES THE FOLLOWING CONDITIONS: 3 (USE RESTRICTIONS), 7 (LIMITED
WARRANTY), 8 (LIMITATIONS OF LIABILITY), 9 (TERMINATION), 10 (GENERAL -
INCLUDING GOVERNING LAW, DISPUTE RESOLUTION, CONFIDENTIALITY AND PUBLICITY,
AND MODIFICATIONS TO THE AGREEMENT).
(e) Waiver. The failure by NICE to enforce any provision of this EULA will
not constitute a present or future waiver of such provision nor will it limit
NICE's right to enforce such provision at a later time. All waivers by NICE
must be in writing to be effective.
(f) Severability. If any portion of this Agreement is held to be invalid or
unenforceable, the remaining portions of this Agreement will remain in full
force and effect. Any invalid or unenforceable portions will be interpreted
to effectuate the intent of the original portion. If such construction is not
possible, the invalid or unenforceable portion will be severed from this
Agreement but the rest of the Agreement will remain in full force and effect.
(g) Taxes. Each party will be responsible, as required under applicable law,
for identifying and paying all taxes and other governmental fees and charges
(and any penalties, interest, and other additions thereto) that are imposed
on that party upon or with respect to the transactions and payments under
this EULA. All fees payable by Licensee are exclusive of applicable taxes and
duties, including VAT, Service Tax, GST, excise taxes, sales and transactions
taxes, and gross receipts tax ("Indirect Taxes"). NICE may charge and
Licensee will pay applicable Indirect Taxes that NICE is legally obligated or
authorized to collect from Licensee. Licensee will provide such information
to NICE as reasonably required to determine whether NICE is obligated to
collect Indirect Taxes from Licensee. NICE will not collect, and Licensee
will not pay, any Indirect Tax for which Licensee furnishes NICE a properly
completed exemption certificate or a direct payment permit certificate for
which NICE may claim an available exemption from such Indirect Tax. All
payments made by Licensee to NICE under this EULA will be made free and clear
of any deduction or withholding, as may be required by law. If any such
deduction or withholding (including cross-border withholding taxes) is
required on any payment, Licensee will pay such additional amounts as are
necessary so that the net amount received by NICE is equal to the amount then
due and payable under this EULA. NICE will provide Licensee with such tax
forms as are reasonably requested in order to reduce or eliminate the amount
of any withholding or deduction for taxes in respect of payments made under
this EULA.
(h) Confidentiality And Publicity. Licensee may use NICE Confidential
Information only in connection with Licensee's use of the Software as
permitted under this EULA. Licensee will not disclose NICE Confidential
Information during the Term or at any time after without NICE's advance
written consent. Licensee will take all reasonable measures to avoid
disclosure, dissemination, or unauthorized use of NICE Confidential
Information, including, at a minimum, those measures Licensee takes to
protect its own confidential information of a similar nature. Licensee will
not issue any press release or make any other public communication with
respect to this EULA or your use of the Software. "NICE Confidential
Information" means all nonpublic information disclosed by NICE its
affiliates, business partners or its or their respective employees,
contractors or agents that is designated as confidential or that, given the
nature of the information or circumstances surrounding its disclosure,
reasonably should be understood to be confidential. NICE Confidential
Information does not include any information that: (i) is or becomes publicly
available without breach of this EULA; (ii) can be shown by documentation to
have been known to Licensee at the time of receipt from NICE; (iii) is
received from a third party who did not acquire or disclose the same by a
wrongful or tortious act; or (iv) can be shown by documentation to have been
independently developed by Licensee without reference to NICE Confidential
Information.
(i) Notices. Any notice required or permitted by this EULA to be given to
either party shall be effective upon receipt and shall be given in writing
and sent by overnight courier, facsimile, or first class certified mail with
postage prepaid. Notices to Licensee will be sent to the addresses indicated
in the applicable order for the Software and to the NICE contracting party at
the address in the opening paragraph of this EULA. Receipt shall be presumed
received 5 business days after mailing by first class mail unless the sender
obtains a delivery receipt indicating it was delivered earlier, the next day
if sent by over-night courier, and when confirmation is received if by fax.
In addition, a copy of the notice shall also be given via e-mail to each
party's primary contact. Either party may designate a different address than
that given below by notice to the other party in accordance with this
paragraph. A copy of any notice required or permitted to be sent to NICE
shall also be sent to Amazon.com, Inc. Attn: General Counsel P.O. Box 81226
Seattle, WA 98108-1226 Fax: (206) 266-7010 E-mail: contracts-legal@amazon.com.
(j) Modifications To The Agreement. NICE may modify this EULA at any time by
posting a revised version on the NICE website (nice-software.com, and any
successor or related site designated by NICE, hereinafter, the "NICE
Website") or by sending a message to the email address then associated with
Licensee's account. Notices of modifications NICE provides by posting on the
NICE Website will be effective upon posting, and notices NICE provides by
email will be effective when NICE sends the email. It is Licensee's
responsibility to keep its email address current. Licensee will be deemed to
have received any email sent to the email address then associated with its
account when NICE sends the email, whether or not Licensee actually receives
the email. By continuing to use the Software after the effective date of any
modifications to this EULA, Licensee agrees to be bound by the modified
terms. It is Licensee's responsibility to check the NICE Website regularly
for modifications to this EULA.
(k) Trade Compliance. In connection with this EULA, Licensee will comply with
all applicable import, re-import, sanctions, anti-boycott, export, and
re-export control laws and regulations, including all such laws and
regulations that apply to a U.S. company, such as the Export Administration
Regulations, the International Traffic in Arms Regulations, and economic
sanctions programs implemented by the Office of Foreign Assets Control. For
clarity, Licensee is solely responsible for compliance related to the manner
in which Licensee chooses to use the Software. Licensee represents and
warrants that Licensee and its financial institutions, or any party that owns
or controls Licensee or its financial institutions, are not subject to
sanctions or otherwise designated on any list of prohibited or restricted
parties, including the lists maintained by the United Nations Security
Council, the US Government (e.g., the US Department of Treasury's Specially
Designated Nationals list and Foreign Sanctions Evaders list and the US
Department of Commerce's Entity List), the European Union or its member
states, or other applicable government authority.
(l) U.S. Government Rights. The Software is provided to the U.S. Government
as "commercial items," "commercial computer software," "commercial computer
software documentation," and "technical data" with the same rights and
restrictions generally applicable to the Software. If you are using the
Software on behalf of the U.S. Government and these terms fail to meet the
U.S. Government's needs or are inconsistent in any respect with federal law,
Licensee will immediately discontinue use of the Software. The terms
"commercial item" "commercial computer software," "commercial computer
software documentation," and "technical data" are defined in the Federal
Acquisition Regulation and the Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation
Supplement.
(m) No Third-Party Beneficiaries. This EULA does not create any third-party
beneficiary rights in any individual or entity that is not a party to this
EULA.

RECITALS

Use of NVIDIA's products requires three elements: the SOFTWARE, the hardware on
a graphics controller board, and a personal computer. The SOFTWARE is protected
by copyright laws and international copyright treaties, as well as other
intellectual property laws and treaties. The SOFTWARE is not sold, and instead
is only licensed for use, strictly in accordance with this document. The
hardware is protected by various patents, and is sold, but this LICENSE does not
cover that sale, since it may not necessarily be sold as a package with the
SOFTWARE. This LICENSE sets forth the terms and conditions of the SOFTWARE
LICENSE only.

1. DEFINITIONS

1.1 Customer. Customer means the entity or individual that downloads the
SOFTWARE.

2. GRANT OF LICENSE

2.1 Rights and Limitations of Grant. NVIDIA hereby grants Customer the following
non-exclusive, non-transferable right to use the SOFTWARE, with the following
limitations:

2.1.1 Rights. Customer may install and use multiple copies of the SOFTWARE on a
shared computer or concurrently on different computers, and make multiple back-
up copies of the SOFTWARE, solely for Customer's use within Customer's
Enterprise. "Enterprise" shall mean individual use by Customer or any legal
entity (such as a corporation or university) and the subsidiaries it owns by
more than fifty percent (50%).

2.1.2 Linux/FreeBSD Exception. Notwithstanding the foregoing terms of Section
2.1.1, SOFTWARE designed exclusively for use on the Linux or FreeBSD operating
systems, or other operating systems derived from the source code to these
operating systems, may be copied and redistributed, provided that the binary
files thereof are not modified in any way (except for unzipping of compressed
files).

2.1.3 Limitations.

No Reverse Engineering. Customer may not reverse engineer, decompile, or
disassemble the SOFTWARE, nor attempt in any other manner to obtain the source
code.

No Separation of Components. The SOFTWARE is licensed as a single product. Its
component parts may not be separated for use on more than one computer, nor
otherwise used separately from the other parts.

No Rental. Customer may not rent or lease the SOFTWARE to someone else.

3. TERMINATION

This LICENSE will automatically terminate if Customer fails to comply with any
of the terms and conditions hereof. In such event, Customer must destroy all
copies of the SOFTWARE and all of its component parts.

Defensive Suspension. If Customer commences or participates in any legal
proceeding against NVIDIA, then NVIDIA may, in its sole discretion, suspend or
terminate all license grants and any other rights provided under this LICENSE
during the pendency of such legal proceedings.

4. COPYRIGHT

All title and copyrights in and to the SOFTWARE (including but not limited to
all images, photographs, animations, video, audio, music, text, and other
information incorporated into the SOFTWARE), the accompanying printed materials,
and any copies of the SOFTWARE, are owned by NVIDIA, or its suppliers. The
SOFTWARE is protected by copyright laws and international treaty provisions.
Accordingly, Customer is required to treat the SOFTWARE like any other
copyrighted material, except as otherwise allowed pursuant to this LICENSE and
that it may make one copy of the SOFTWARE solely for backup or archive purposes.

5. APPLICABLE LAW

This LICENSE shall be deemed to have been made in, and shall be construed
pursuant to, the laws of the State of Delaware. The United Nations Convention on
Contracts for the International Sale of Goods is specifically disclaimed.

determining and verifying that the SOFTWARE that you obtain and install is the
appropriate version for your model of graphics controller board, operating
system, and computer hardware.

6.2 No Liability for Consequential Damages. TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY
APPLICABLE LAW, IN NO EVENT SHALL NVIDIA OR ITS SUPPLIERS BE LIABLE FOR ANY
SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, INDIRECT, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES WHATSOEVER (INCLUDING,
WITHOUT LIMITATION, DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF BUSINESS PROFITS, LOSS OF DATA, BUSINESS
INTERRUPTION, LOSS OF BUSINESS INFORMATION, OR ANY OTHER PECUNIARY LOSS) ARISING
OUT OF THE USE OF OR INABILITY TO USE THE SOFTWARE, EVEN IF NVIDIA HAS BEEN
ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

7. SYSTEM UPDATES

NVIDIA Update control panel for the SOFTWARE.

8. MISCELLANEOUS

If any provision of this LICENSE is inconsistent with, or cannot be fully
enforced under, the law, such provision will be construed as limited to the
extent necessary to be consistent with and fully enforceable under the law. This
LICENSE is the final, complete and exclusive agreement between the parties
relating to the subject matter hereof, and supersedes all prior or
contemporaneous understandings and agreements relating to such subject matter,
whether oral or written. This LICENSE may only be modified in writing signed by
an authorized officer of NVIDIA. Customer agrees that it will not ship, transfer

parallelcluster.s3.amazonaws.com/archives/dependencies/cuda/samples/

1.1. Licenseï
1.1.1. License Grantï
Subject to the terms of this Agreement, NVIDIA hereby grants you a non-
exclusive, non-transferable license, without the right to sublicense (except as
expressly provided in this Agreement) to:

Install and use the SDK,

Modify and create derivative works of sample source code delivered in the SDK,
and

Distribute those portions of the SDK that are identified in this Agreement as
distributable, as incorporated in object code format into a software application
that meets the distribution requirements indicated in this Agreement.

1.1.2. Distribution Requirementsï
These are the distribution requirements for you to exercise the distribution
grant:

Your application must have material additional functionality, beyond the
included portions of the SDK.

The distributable portions of the SDK shall only be accessed by your
application.

The following notice shall be included in modifications and derivative works of
sample source code distributed: âThis software contains source code provided by
NVIDIA Corporation.â

Unless a developer tool is identified in this Agreement as distributable, it is
delivered for your internal use only.

The terms under which you distribute your application must be consistent with
the terms of this Agreement, including (without limitation) terms relating to
the license grant and license restrictions and protection of NVIDIAâs
intellectual property rights. Additionally, you agree that you will protect the
privacy, security and legal rights of your application users.

You agree to notify NVIDIA in writing of any known or suspected distribution or
use of the SDK not in compliance with the requirements of this Agreement, and to
enforce the terms of your agreements with respect to distributed SDK.

1.1.3. Authorized Usersï
You may allow employees and contractors of your entity or of your
subsidiary(ies) to access and use the SDK from your secure network to perform
work on your behalf.

If you are an academic institution you may allow users enrolled or employed by
the academic institution to access and use the SDK from your secure network.

You are responsible for the compliance with the terms of this Agreement by your
authorized users. If you become aware that your authorized users didnât follow
the terms of this Agreement, you agree to take reasonable steps to resolve the
non-compliance and prevent new occurrences.

1.1.4. Pre-Release SDKï
The SDK versions identified as alpha, beta, preview or otherwise as pre-release,
may not be fully functional, may contain errors or design flaws, and may have
reduced or different security, privacy, accessibility, availability, and
reliability standards relative to commercial versions of NVIDIA software and
materials. Use of a pre-release SDK may result in unexpected results, loss of
data, project delays or other unpredictable damage or loss.

You may use a pre-release SDK at your own risk, understanding that pre-release
SDKs are not intended for use in production or business-critical systems.

NVIDIA may choose not to make available a commercial version of any pre-release
SDK. NVIDIA may also choose to abandon development and terminate the
availability of a pre-release SDK at any time without liability.

1.1.5. Updatesï
NVIDIA may, at its option, make available patches, workarounds or other updates
to this SDK. Unless the updates are provided with their separate governing
terms, they are deemed part of the SDK licensed to you as provided in this
Agreement. You agree that the form and content of the SDK that NVIDIA provides
may change without prior notice to you. While NVIDIA generally maintains
compatibility between versions, NVIDIA may in some cases make changes that
introduce incompatibilities in future versions of the SDK.

1.1.6. Components Under Other Licensesï
The SDK may come bundled with, or otherwise include or be distributed with,
NVIDIA or third-party components with separate legal notices or terms as may be
described in proprietary notices accompanying the SDK. If and to the extent
there is a conflict between the terms in this Agreement and the license terms
associated with the component, the license terms associated with the components
control only to the extent necessary to resolve the conflict.

Subject to the other terms of this Agreement, you may use the SDK to develop and
test applications released under Open Source Initiative (OSI) approved open
source software licenses.

1.1.7. Reservation of Rightsï
NVIDIA reserves all rights, title, and interest in and to the SDK, not expressly
granted to you under this Agreement.

1.2. Limitationsï
The following license limitations apply to your use of the SDK:

You may not reverse engineer, decompile or disassemble, or remove copyright or
other proprietary notices from any portion of the SDK or copies of the SDK.

Except as expressly provided in this Agreement, you may not copy, sell, rent,
sublicense, transfer, distribute, modify, or create derivative works of any
portion of the SDK. For clarity, you may not distribute or sublicense the SDK as
a stand-alone product.

Unless you have an agreement with NVIDIA for this purpose, you may not indicate
that an application created with the SDK is sponsored or endorsed by NVIDIA.

You may not bypass, disable, or circumvent any encryption, security, digital
rights management or authentication mechanism in the SDK.

You may not use the SDK in any manner that would cause it to become subject to
an open source software license. As examples, licenses that require as a
condition of use, modification, and/or distribution that the SDK be:

Disclosed or distributed in source code form;

Licensed for the purpose of making derivative works; or

Redistributable at no charge.

You acknowledge that the SDK as delivered is not tested or certified by NVIDIA
for use in connection with the design, construction, maintenance, and/or
operation of any system where the use or failure of such system could result in
a situation that threatens the safety of human life or results in catastrophic
damages (each, a âCritical Applicationâ). Examples of Critical Applications
include use in avionics, navigation, autonomous vehicle applications, ai
solutions for automotive products, military, medical, life support or other life
critical applications. NVIDIA shall not be liable to you or any third party, in
whole or in part, for any claims or damages arising from such uses. You are
solely responsible for ensuring that any product or service developed with the
SDK as a whole includes sufficient features to comply with all applicable legal
and regulatory standards and requirements.

You agree to defend, indemnify and hold harmless NVIDIA and its affiliates, and
their respective employees, contractors, agents, officers and directors, from
and against any and all claims, damages, obligations, losses, liabilities, costs
or debt, fines, restitutions and expenses (including but not limited to
attorneyâs fees and costs incident to establishing the right of indemnification)
arising out of or related to products or services that use the SDK in or for
Critical Applications, and for use of the SDK outside of the scope of this
Agreement or not in compliance with its terms.

You may not reverse engineer, decompile or disassemble any portion of the output
generated using SDK elements for the purpose of translating such output
artifacts to target a non-NVIDIA platform.

1.3. Ownershipï
NVIDIA or its licensors hold all rights, title and interest in and to the SDK
and its modifications and derivative works, including their respective
intellectual property rights, subject to your rights under Section 1.3.2. This
SDK may include software and materials from NVIDIAâs licensors, and these
licensors are intended third party beneficiaries that may enforce this Agreement
with respect to their intellectual property rights.

You hold all rights, title and interest in and to your applications and your
derivative works of the sample source code delivered in the SDK, including their
respective intellectual property rights, subject to NVIDIAâs rights under
Section 1.3.1.

You may, but donât have to, provide to NVIDIA suggestions, feature requests or
other feedback regarding the SDK, including possible enhancements or
modifications to the SDK. For any feedback that you voluntarily provide, you
hereby grant NVIDIA and its affiliates a perpetual, non-exclusive, worldwide,
irrevocable license to use, reproduce, modify, license, sublicense (through
multiple tiers of sublicensees), and distribute (through multiple tiers of
distributors) it without the payment of any royalties or fees to you. NVIDIA
will use feedback at its choice. NVIDIA is constantly looking for ways to
improve its products, so you may send feedback to NVIDIA through the developer
portal at https://developer.nvidia.com.

1.4. No Warrantiesï
THE SDK IS PROVIDED BY NVIDIA âAS ISâ AND âWITH ALL FAULTS.â TO THE MAXIMUM
EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, NVIDIA AND ITS AFFILIATES EXPRESSLY DISCLAIM ALL
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND OR NATURE, WHETHER EXPRESS, IMPLIED OR STATUTORY,
INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, ANY WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A
PARTICULAR PURPOSE, TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, OR THE ABSENCE OF ANY DEFECTS
THEREIN, WHETHER LATENT OR PATENT. NO WARRANTY IS MADE ON THE BASIS OF TRADE
USAGE, COURSE OF DEALING OR COURSE OF TRADE.

1.5. Limitation of Liabilityï
TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, NVIDIA AND ITS AFFILIATES SHALL NOT BE
LIABLE FOR ANY (I) SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, PUNITIVE OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, OR
(II) DAMAGES FOR (A) ANY LOST PROFITS, LOSS OF USE, LOSS OF DATA OR LOSS OF
GOODWILL, OR (B) THE COSTS OF PROCURING SUBSTITUTE PRODUCTS, ARISING OUT OF OR
IN CONNECTION WITH THIS AGREEMENT OR THE USE OR PERFORMANCE OF THE SDK, WHETHER
SUCH LIABILITY ARISES FROM ANY CLAIM BASED UPON BREACH OF CONTRACT, BREACH OF
WARRANTY, TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), PRODUCT LIABILITY OR ANY OTHER CAUSE OF
ACTION OR THEORY OF LIABILITY. IN NO EVENT WILL NVIDIAâS AND ITS AFFILIATES
TOTAL CUMULATIVE LIABILITY UNDER OR ARISING OUT OF THIS AGREEMENT EXCEED
US$10.00. THE NATURE OF THE LIABILITY OR THE NUMBER OF CLAIMS OR SUITS SHALL NOT
ENLARGE OR EXTEND THIS LIMIT.

These exclusions and limitations of liability shall apply regardless if NVIDIA
or its affiliates have been advised of the possibility of such damages, and
regardless of whether a remedy fails its essential purpose. These exclusions and
limitations of liability form an essential basis of the bargain between the
parties, and, absent any of these exclusions or limitations of liability, the
provisions of this Agreement, including, without limitation, the economic terms,
would be substantially different.

1.6. Terminationï
This Agreement will continue to apply until terminated by either you or NVIDIA
as described below.

If you want to terminate this Agreement, you may do so by stopping to use the
SDK.

NVIDIA may, at any time, terminate this Agreement if:

(i) you fail to comply with any term of this Agreement and the non-compliance is
not fixed within thirty (30) days following notice from NVIDIA (or immediately
if you violate NVIDIAâs intellectual property rights);

(ii) you commence or participate in any legal proceeding against NVIDIA with
respect to the SDK; or

(iii) NVIDIA decides to no longer provide the SDK in a country or, in NVIDIAâs
sole discretion, the continued use of it is no longer commercially viable.

Upon any termination of this Agreement, you agree to promptly discontinue use of
the SDK and destroy all copies in your possession or control. Your prior
distributions in accordance with this Agreement are not affected by the
termination of this Agreement. Upon written request, you will certify in writing
that you have complied with your commitments under this section. Upon any
termination of this Agreement all provisions survive except for the license
grant provisions.

1.7. Generalï
If you wish to assign this Agreement or your rights and obligations, including
by merger, consolidation, dissolution or operation of law, contact NVIDIA to ask
for permission. Any attempted assignment not approved by NVIDIA in writing shall
be void and of no effect. NVIDIA may assign, delegate or transfer this Agreement
and its rights and obligations, and if to a non-affiliate you will be notified.

You agree to cooperate with NVIDIA and provide reasonably requested information
to verify your compliance with this Agreement.

This Agreement will be governed in all respects by the laws of the United States
and of the State of Delaware, without regard to the conflicts of laws
principles. The United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International
Sale of Goods is specifically disclaimed. You agree to all terms of this
Agreement in the English language.

The state or federal courts residing in Santa Clara County, California shall
have exclusive jurisdiction over any dispute or claim arising out of this
Agreement. Notwithstanding this, you agree that NVIDIA shall still be allowed to
apply for injunctive remedies or an equivalent type of urgent legal relief in
any jurisdiction.

If any court of competent jurisdiction determines that any provision of this
Agreement is illegal, invalid or unenforceable, such provision will be construed
as limited to the extent necessary to be consistent with and fully enforceable
under the law and the remaining provisions will remain in full force and effect.

1.1.1. License Grant

Subject to the terms of this Agreement, NVIDIA hereby grants you a non-
exclusive, non-transferable license, without the right to sublicense (except as
expressly provided in this Agreement) to:

    Install and use the SDK,
    Modify and create derivative works of sample source code delivered in the
SDK, and
    Distribute those portions of the SDK that are identified in this Agreement
as distributable, as incorporated in object code format into a software
application that meets the distribution requirements indicated in this
Agreement.

1.1.2. Distribution Requirements
These are the distribution requirements for you to exercise the distribution
grant:

    Your application must have material additional functionality, beyond the
included portions of the SDK.
    The distributable portions of the SDK shall only be accessed by your
application.
    The following notice shall be included in modifications and derivative works
of sample source code distributed: âThis software contains source code provided
by NVIDIA Corporation.â
    Unless a developer tool is identified in this Agreement as distributable, it
is delivered for your internal use only.
    The terms under which you distribute your application must be consistent
with the terms of this Agreement, including (without limitation) terms relating
to the license grant and license restrictions and protection of NVIDIAâs
intellectual property rights. Additionally, you agree that you will protect the
privacy, security and legal rights of your application users.
    You agree to notify NVIDIA in writing of any known or suspected distribution
or use of the SDK not in compliance with the requirements of this Agreement, and
to enforce the terms of your agreements with respect to distributed SDK.

1.1.3. Authorized Users

You may allow employees and contractors of your entity or of your
subsidiary(ies) to access and use the SDK from your secure network to perform
work on your behalf.

If you are an academic institution you may allow users enrolled or employed by
the academic institution to access and use the SDK from your secure network.

You are responsible for the compliance with the terms of this Agreement by your
authorized users. If you become aware that your authorized users didnât follow
the terms of this Agreement, you agree to take reasonable steps to resolve the
non-compliance and prevent new occurrences.
1.1.4. Pre-Release SDK

The SDK versions identified as alpha, beta, preview or otherwise as pre-release,
may not be fully functional, may contain errors or design flaws, and may have
reduced or different security, privacy, accessibility, availability, and
reliability standards relative to commercial versions of NVIDIA software and
materials. Use of a pre-release SDK may result in unexpected results, loss of
data, project delays or other unpredictable damage or loss.

You may use a pre-release SDK at your own risk, understanding that pre-release
SDKs are not intended for use in production or business-critical systems.

NVIDIA may choose not to make available a commercial version of any pre-release
SDK. NVIDIA may also choose to abandon development and terminate the
availability of a pre-release SDK at any time without liability.
1.1.5. Updates

NVIDIA may, at its option, make available patches, workarounds or other updates
to this SDK. Unless the updates are provided with their separate governing
terms, they are deemed part of the SDK licensed to you as provided in this
Agreement. You agree that the form and content of the SDK that NVIDIA provides
may change without prior notice to you. While NVIDIA generally maintains
compatibility between versions, NVIDIA may in some cases make changes that
introduce incompatibilities in future versions of the SDK.
1.1.6. Third Party Licenses

The SDK may come bundled with, or otherwise include or be distributed with,
third party software licensed by a NVIDIA supplier and/or open source software
provided under an open source license. Use of third party software is subject to
the third-party license terms, or in the absence of third party terms, the terms
of this Agreement. Copyright to third party software is held by the copyright

or other proprietary notices from any portion of the SDK or copies of the SDK.
    Except as expressly provided in this Agreement, you may not copy, sell,
rent, sublicense, transfer, distribute, modify, or create derivative works of
any portion of the SDK. For clarity, you may not distribute or sublicense the
SDK as a stand-alone product.
    Unless you have an agreement with NVIDIA for this purpose, you may not
indicate that an application created with the SDK is sponsored or endorsed by
NVIDIA.
    You may not bypass, disable, or circumvent any encryption, security, digital
rights management or authentication mechanism in the SDK.
    You may not use the SDK in any manner that would cause it to become subject
to an open source software license. As examples, licenses that require as a
condition of use, modification, and/or distribution that the SDK be:
        Disclosed or distributed in source code form;
        Licensed for the purpose of making derivative works; or
        Redistributable at no charge.
    Unless you have an agreement with NVIDIA for this purpose, you may not use
the SDK with any system or application where the use or failure of the system or
application can reasonably be expected to threaten or result in personal injury,
death, or catastrophic loss. Examples include use in nuclear, avionics,
navigation, military, medical, life support or other life critical applications.
NVIDIA does not design, test or manufacture the SDK for these critical uses and
NVIDIA shall not be liable to you or any third party, in whole or in part, for
any claims or damages arising from such uses.
    You agree to defend, indemnify and hold harmless NVIDIA and its affiliates,
and their respective employees, contractors, agents, officers and directors,
from and against any and all claims, damages, obligations, losses, liabilities,
costs or debt, fines, restitutions and expenses (including but not limited to

1.4. No Warranties

THE SDK IS PROVIDED BY NVIDIA âAS ISâ AND âWITH ALL FAULTS.â TO THE MAXIMUM
EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, NVIDIA AND ITS AFFILIATES EXPRESSLY DISCLAIM ALL
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND OR NATURE, WHETHER EXPRESS, IMPLIED OR STATUTORY,
INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, ANY WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A
PARTICULAR PURPOSE, TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, OR THE ABSENCE OF ANY DEFECTS
THEREIN, WHETHER LATENT OR PATENT. NO WARRANTY IS MADE ON THE BASIS OF TRADE
USAGE, COURSE OF DEALING OR COURSE OF TRADE.
1.5. Limitation of Liability

TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, NVIDIA AND ITS AFFILIATES SHALL NOT BE
LIABLE FOR ANY SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, PUNITIVE OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, OR ANY
LOST PROFITS, LOSS OF USE, LOSS OF DATA OR LOSS OF GOODWILL, OR THE COSTS OF
PROCURING SUBSTITUTE PRODUCTS, ARISING OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THIS
AGREEMENT OR THE USE OR PERFORMANCE OF THE SDK, WHETHER SUCH LIABILITY ARISES
FROM ANY CLAIM BASED UPON BREACH OF CONTRACT, BREACH OF WARRANTY, TORT
(INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), PRODUCT LIABILITY OR ANY OTHER CAUSE OF ACTION OR THEORY
OF LIABILITY. IN NO EVENT WILL NVIDIAâS AND ITS AFFILIATES TOTAL CUMULATIVE
LIABILITY UNDER OR ARISING OUT OF THIS AGREEMENT EXCEED US$10.00. THE NATURE OF
THE LIABILITY OR THE NUMBER OF CLAIMS OR SUITS SHALL NOT ENLARGE OR EXTEND THIS
LIMIT.

These exclusions and limitations of liability shall apply regardless if NVIDIA
or its affiliates have been advised of the possibility of such damages, and
regardless of whether a remedy fails its essential purpose. These exclusions and
limitations of liability form an essential basis of the bargain between the
parties, and, absent any of these exclusions or limitations of liability, the
provisions of this Agreement, including, without limitation, the economic terms,
would be substantially different.
1.6. Termination

    This Agreement will continue to apply until terminated by either you or
NVIDIA as described below.
    If you want to terminate this Agreement, you may do so by stopping to use
the SDK.
    NVIDIA may, at any time, terminate this Agreement if:

compliance is not fixed within thirty (30) days following notice from NVIDIA (or
immediately if you violate NVIDIAâs intellectual property rights);
        (ii) you commence or participate in any legal proceeding against NVIDIA
with respect to the SDK; or
        (iii) NVIDIA decides to no longer provide the SDK in a country or, in
NVIDIAâs sole discretion, the continued use of it is no longer commercially
viable.
    Upon any termination of this Agreement, you agree to promptly discontinue
use of the SDK and destroy all copies in your possession or control. Your prior
distributions in accordance with this Agreement are not affected by the
termination of this Agreement. Upon written request, you will certify in writing
that you have complied with your commitments under this section. Upon any
termination of this Agreement all provisions survive except for the license
grant provisions.
