# Verifies multiple Network Interfaces recipes
# These recipes can be tested on EC2 on instance type with multiple network interfaces
# https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/using-eni.html
#
# To run this test you need to:
# - find the right avail zone/subnet to launch a p4d instance
# - launch a t2 EC2 instance to use as entry point for your tests, since p4d cannot have public ips
# - connect to the entry point instance and use it for subsequent actions
#
# - download git and cinc-workstation
# curl -L https://omnitruck.cinc.sh/install.sh | sudo bash -s -- -P cinc-workstation -v 23
# sudo yum install -y git
# - download cookbook code
# git clone https://github.com/aws/aws-parallelcluster-cookbook
# - set temporary AWS CLI environment variables to EC2 instances
# - populate .kitchen.env.sh setting KITCHEN_SUBNET_ID to point to a private subnet for the p4d instance
# - verify security group
# - launch the test with "create"
# - manually create new network interfaces and attach them to the running instance, to the network card with index 0
# - launch kitchen converge and verify steps
# bash kitchen.ec2.sh multinic converge network-interfaces-alinux2
# bash kitchen.ec2.sh multinic verify network-interfaces-alinux2
