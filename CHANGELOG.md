**BUG FIXES**

2.6.1
-----

**ENHANCEMENTS**
- Change ProctrackType from proctrack/gpid to proctrack/cgroup in slurm.conf in order to better handle termination of
  stray processes when running MPI applications. This also includes the creation of a cgroup Slurm configuration in
  in order to enable the cgroup plugin.
- Skip execution, at node bootstrap time, of all those install recipes that are already applied at AMI creation time.
  The old behaviour can be restored setting the property "skip_install_recipes" to "no" through extra_json. The old 
  behaviour is required in case a custom_node_package is specified and could be needed in case custom_cookbook is used
  (depending or not if the custom cookbook contains changes into any *_install recipes)
- Start CloudWatch agent earlier in the node bootstrapping phase so that cookbook execution failures are correctly
  uploaded and are available for troubleshooting.

**CHANGES**
- FSx Lustre: remove `x-systemd.requires=lnet.service` from mount options in order to rely on default lnet setup
  provided by Lustre.
- Enforce Packer version to be >= 1.4.0 when building an AMI. This is also required for customers using `pcluster 
  createami` command.
- Remove /tmp/proxy.sh file. Proxy configuration is now written into /etc/profile.d/proxy.sh
- Omit cfn-init-cmd and cfn-wire from the files stored in CloudWatch logs.

**BUG FIXES**
- Fix installation of Intel Parallel Studio XE Runtime that requires yum4 since version 2019.5.
- Fix compilation of Torque scheduler on Ubuntu 18.04.

2.4.1
-----

**ENHANCEMENTS**
- Install IntelMPI on Alinux, Centos 7 and Ubuntu 1604
- Upgrade EFA to version 1.4.1
- Run all node daemons and cookbook recipes in isolated Python virtualenvs. This allows our code to always run with the
  required Python dependencies and solves all conflicts and runtime failures that were being caused by user packages
  installed in the system Python

**CHANGES**
- Torque: upgrade to version 6.1.2
- Run all node daemons with Python 3.6
- Torque: changed following parameters in global configuration:
  - `server node_check_rate = 120` - Specifies the minimum duration (in seconds)
    that a node can fail to send a status update before being marked down by the
    pbs_server daemon. Previously was 600. This reduces scaling reaction times in
    case of instance failure or unexpected termination (especially with spot)
  - `server node_ping_rate = 60` - Specifies the maximum interval (in seconds)
    between successive "pings" sent from the pbs_server daemon to the pbs_mom
    daemon to determine node/daemon health. Previously was 300. Setting it to half
    the node_check_rate.
  - `server timeout_for_job_delete = 30` - The specific timeout used when deleting
    jobs because the node they are executing on is being deleted. Previously was
    120. This prevents job deletion to hang for more than 30 seconds when the node
    they are running on is being deleted.
  - `server timeout_for_job_requeue = 30` - The specific timeout used when requeuing
    jobs because the node they are executing on is being deleted. Previously was
    120. This prevents node deletion to hang for more than 30 seconds when a job
    cannot be rescheduled.

**BUG FIXES**
- Restore correct value for `filehandle_limit` that was getting reset when setting `memory_limit` for EFA
- Torque: fix configuration of server operators that was preventing compute nodes from disabling themselves
  before termination


2.4.0
-----

**ENHANCEMENTS**
- Add support for EFA on Centos 7, Amazon Linux and Ubuntu 1604
- Add support for Ubuntu in China region `cn-northwest-1`

**CHANGES**
- SGE: changed following parameters in global configuration
  - `max_unheard 00:03:00`: allows a faster reaction in case of faulty nodes
  - `reschedule_unknown 00:00:30`: enables rescheduling of jobs running on failing nodes
  - `qmaster_params ENABLE_FORCED_QDEL_IF_UNKNOWN`: forces job deletion on unresponsive nodes
  - `qmaster_params ENABLE_RESCHEDULE_KILL`: forces rescheduling or killing of jobs running on failing nodes
- Slurm: decrease SlurmdTimeout to 120 seconds to speed up replacement of faulty nodes
- Always use full master FQDN when mounting NFS on compute nodes. This solves some issues occurring with some networking
  setups and custom DNS configurations
- Set soft and hard ulimit on open files to 10000 for all supported OSs
- Pin python `supervisor` version to 3.4.0
- Remove unused `compute_instance_type` from jobwatcher.cfg
- Removed unused `max_queue_size` from sqswatcher.cfg
- Remove double quoting of the post_install args

**BUG FIXES**
- Fix issue that was preventing Torque from being used on Centos 7
- Start node daemons at the end of instance initialization. The time spent for post-install script and node
  initialization is not counted as part of node idletime anymore.
- Fix issue which was causing an additional and invalid EBS mount point to be added in case of multiple EBS
- Install Slurm libpmpi/libpmpi2 that is distributed in a separate package since Slurm 17
