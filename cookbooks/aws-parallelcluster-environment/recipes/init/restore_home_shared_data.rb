  # Restore the shared storage home data if it doesn't already exist
  # This is necessary to preserve any data in these directories that was
  # generated during the build of ParallelCluster AMIs after converting to
  # shared storage and backed up to a temporary location previously.
  # Before removing the backup, ensure the data in the new home is the same
  # as the original to avoid any data loss or inconsistency. This is done
  # by using rsync to copy the data and diff to check for differences.
  # The diff command excludes files that were originally in /home to focus on
  # the newly synchronized files. This approach is necessary because the /home
  # directory may contain pre-existing files such as slurm-*.out generated by
  # running SLURM jobs and the automatically created lost+found directory.
  # Remove the backup after the copy is done and the data integrity is verified.
